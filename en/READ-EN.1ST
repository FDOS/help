hhstndrd.zip
============

This contains the bulk of the html documents for use
with help.exe (htmlhelp).

IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE UNZIPPED - help.exe can read
the html files from within hhstndrd.zip.

(You may wish to unzip the html files so that they
can be read with another browser, or to edit them.
Zip files usually take priority over uncompressed files;
if you want to make sure that help reads an edited,
uncompressed version of a file, you should replace or
delete the original version inside hhstndrd.zip)

CODEPAGE SUPPORT:

The different languages of the help require different codepages.
If characters are not shown as you expect it, the installed
codepage will be wrong!

FDCONFIG.SYS / CONFIG.SYS examples for how to install codepages:

country=001,437,c:\freedos\bin\country.sys   (US settings)
country=033,858,c:\freedos\bin\country.sys   (French settings)
country=034,858,c:\freedos\bin\country.sys   (Spanish settings)
country=049,858,c:\freedos\bin\country.sys   (German settings)

You can find your country code and the codepages at section
"external commands - country.sys" and at section
"Miscellaneous - kpdos".


Corresponding, FDAUTO.BAT /AUTOEXEC.BAT should look like this:

set LANG=EN
lh display con=(EGA,437,1)
mode con cp prep=((437) &percnt;DOSDIR&percnt;\CPI\EGA.CPX)
mode con cop sel=437
mode con cp refresh

Depending on your country your LANG(uage) should be set to EN/FR/ES/DE
etc.
Ensure that there exists a "htmlhelp.en/fr/es/de" etc. in the "NLS"
folder, otherwise help.exe will hang! If not, create one, e.g. by
copying another language.
Please replace "437" by your codepage, see above.
In section "Miscellaneous - cpidos" you will find the EGAx.CPX file
that corresonds with your codepage number. (There exist EGA.cpx until
EGA18.cpx!)
