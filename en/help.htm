<h2>Understanding Help Topic "Syntax"</h2>
<p>On most help topics you will see something like this:</p>
<pre>
<b>   command required [optional] [/switch] [/A|/B]</b>
</pre>
<p>Here is an explaination of the different parts of this line:</p>
<pre>
   <b>command</b>
   This is the name of the command

   <b>required</b>
   Anything that follows the command name, which is not in
   square brackets, [ and ], is a required parameter.
   The command will report an error if you don't give this
   information.

   <b>[optional]</b>
   options are written in square brackets, [ and ]. These change the
   way the command runs. The square brackets aren't meant
   to be typed when the command is used.

   <b>[/switch]</b>
   Options that begin with a / are called switches. The / symbol is
   actually typed when the switch is used.

   <b>[/A|/B]</b>
   When there is a | symbol, this means there is a choice between
   two options. Either /A or /B is allowed, but not both.
   The | isn't meant to be typed when the command is used.

<a name="otherway"><h1>Other Ways of Getting Help</h1></a>
1. Most commands will describe their function and options, by using <b>/?</b> on
them at the command line. For example:
<pre>
   dir /?
</pre>
2. The command <a href="hhstndrd/fasthelp.htm">fasthelp</a>.
This is a clone of MS-DOS fasthelp.
If you can't find what you are looking for in help, it may be in fasthelp,
or vice versa.<br><br>
3. The commands <a href="hhstndrd/whatis.htm">Whatis and Apropos</a><br><br>
4. The doc subdirectory in the DOS directory contains many of the detailed manuals
for various FreeDOS programs.<br><br>
5. Visit the FreeDOS website, <a href="http://www.freedos.org">www.freedos.org</a>
