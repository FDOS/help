<h1>diskcopy</h1>
Copy the contents of a <i>floppy disk</i> to a second floppy. Also
creates, copies and restores floppy disk image files.
<pre>
  <b>diskcopy source destination [options]</b>
</pre>
If the source and/or destination is a drive, for example "a:"
then it is treated as a floppy disk, otherwise it is treated
as an image file.<br><br>
<b>The source and destination can be the same drive</b>; diskcopy will
first copy from the source, and then prompt you to swap floppy disks.
Then it will write to the destination.<br><br>
<h2>Options</h2>
<pre>
  <b>/1</b>
  Doesn't do anything in FreeDOS diskcopy.
  In other versions of DOS, this copied the first side only.

  <b>/v</b>
  Verify that the data is copied correctly.
</pre>
<h2>Notes</h2>
Diskcopy uses the Linux rawrite format for its image files. Therefore the
image files from Diskcopy can be used by Rawrite and vice versa.<br><br>

Diskcopy cannot read from or overwrite Linux floppy disks. It can, however,
write a Linux floppy image to a DOS disk.
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
   diskcopy a: a:
