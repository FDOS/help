<h1>Command: batch files</h1>
<pre>
  BATCH FILES contain a sequence of DOS commands. By running the BATCH
  FILE, this sequence is run. This can be used to save time, so that a
  set of commands does not have to be typed out in full at the DOS prompt
  each time.
  BATCH FILES are text files, but with the .bat file extension. They can
  be created or edited with a text editor such as <a href="../base/edit.htm">EDIT</a> or <a href="../base/edlin.htm">EDLIN</a>.
  To run a BATCH FILE, simply type its name at the DOS prompt, with or
  without the .bat extension.
  A very important BATCH FILE, <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT / FDAUTO.BAT</a> is run
  automatically when FreeDOS starts. You can load necessary drivers while
  booting the system with this file. Of course it also can be edited
  according to your requirements.

                command line.

  <a href="../batch/lh.htm">lh</a>            Loads a program into the upper memory area.
  <a href="../batch/lh.htm">loadhigh</a>      Loads a program into the upper memory area.
  <a href="../batch/path.htm">path</a>          Displays or sets a search path for executable files.

  You can use the commands alias, beep, choice, cls, echo, lh, loadhigh,
  path, prompt and set outside of a batch file too.
  BATCH commands are a command internal to command.com
  and need no other file in order to work.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  IN A .BAT FILE / AUTOEXEC.BAT:
    Example for creating a batch file:
      type: edit foo.bat
    then edit should open and you can type the following example in it:
      C:\FREEDOS\BIN\chkdsk c:
      C:\FREEDOS\BIN\defrag c:
      C:\FREEDOS\BIN\dosfsck c:
    then goto "file" - "save" and close edit.
    When you type foo.bat the commands will be executed.
