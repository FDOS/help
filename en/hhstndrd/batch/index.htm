<h1>batch files</h1>
<p>Batch files contain a sequence of DOS commands. By running the batch file, this sequence is run. This can
be used to save time, so that a set of commands does not have to be typed out in full at the
DOS prompt each time.</p>
<p>Batch files are text files, but with the .bat file extension. They can be created or edited with a text
editor such as <a href="../edit.htm">edit</a>.</p>
<p>To run a batch file, simply type its name at the DOS prompt, with or without the .bat extension:</p>
<pre>
   c:\autoexec.bat
   foo
   foo.bat
</pre>
<p>A very important batch file, <a href="autoexec.htm">autoexec.bat</a>, is run automatically when FreeDOS 
starts</p>
<h2>Commands designed for batch files</h2>

<pre>
