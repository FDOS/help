<h1>lastdrive</h1>
This is a config.sys command.
Sets the last letter to which a drive can be assigned.
<pre>
   <b>lastdrive=L</b>
</pre>
<p>where <b>L</b> is the last letter that will be available.</p>
<p>By default, FreeDOS will set <b>L</b> high enough for all floppy drives and detectable hard drive
partitions, plus one for a CD or other drive. 
<p>You may want to set <b>L</b> higher if you wish to use more than one drive that FreeDOS cannot detect
automatically (CD drives, zip drives etc.)</p>
<p>Setting <b>L</b> higher than necessary wastes a small amount of memory.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
   lastdrive=z
</pre>
