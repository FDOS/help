<h1>files</h1>
This is a config.sys command. It tells FreeDOS how many files it should
be able to have open simulataneously.
<pre>
   <b>files=n</b>
</pre>
<p>where n is the number of files, in the range 8-255.</p>
<p>The default setting is 8, but a good number for most modern systems is 20.
Some programs may need a higher setting to function correctly; such programs will
usually give the value that is needed in their documentation.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
   files=20
