<h1>xcopy</h1>
Copies files and directories, including subdirectories. 
<pre>
   <b>copy {d: | [d:]path} [d:][path] [options]</b>
</pre>
<h2>Options</h2>
<pre>
  <b>{d: | d:path}</b>
  The source to copy from.  This must be either a drive or a full
  path.

  <b>d:path</b>
  The destination to copy to.  If not present, xcopy
  assumes the working directory.

  <b>/A</b>
  Only copy files with the Archive bit set.

  <b>/M</b>
  Only copy files with the Archive bit set, and turn off the A bit.

  <b>/H</b>
  Also copies hidden and system files.

  <b>/D</b>
  The destination is a directory. Cannot be used with /F.

  <b>/F</b>
  The destination is a file. Cannot be used with /D

  <b>/N</b>
  Same as /Y.

  <b>/P</b>
  Prompt for confirmation before each file.

  <b>/Q</b>
  Doesn't report the filenames of copied files.

  <b>/R</b>
  Allow read-only files to be overwritten.

  <b>/S</b>
  Copy subdirectories, except empty ones.

  <b>/E</b>
  Copy subdirectories, even if empty.

  <b>/V</b>
  Verify each file as it is written to disk.

  <b>/W</b>
  Wait before copying any files. Presents a prompt, which you
  must first acknowledge.

  <b>/Y</b>
  No prompting for confirmation of overwriting files.
</pre>

<h2>Notes</h2>
The COPYCMD environment variable can be set to make <b>/Y</b> (or <b>/N</b>) the default:
<pre>
   <a href="set.htm">set</a> <b>COPYCMD=/Y</b>
</pre>
To cancel the <b>/Y</b> for a particular xcopy command, use <b>/-Y</b> at the command line.<br><br>
The COPYCMD variable also affects the <a href="copy.htm">copy</a> command.
Use <b>/Y</b> to change the way both copy and xcopy behave.
Use <b>/N</b>, which copy ignores, to change only the way xcopy behaves.
