<h1>sys</h1>
Make a floppy disk or hard disk bootable. 
<pre>
  <b>sys [[d:]path] d: [bootsect [BOTH]] [BOOTONLY] [switches]</b>
</pre>
<h2>Options</h2>
<pre>
  <b>[[d:]path]</b>
  The (optional) location of the system files.
  If not given, the current directory is assumed.

  <b>d:</b>
  The drive to make bootable.

  <b>bootsect</b>
  The name of file, to which the 512-byte boot sector image
  will be written.
  (the drive's real boot sector won't be
   written to unless BOTH is used.)

  <b>BOTH</b>
  The new boot sector will be written to the image file
  and to the actual drive boot sector.

  <b>BOOTONLY</b>
  With this option the boot sector (or image) will be updated,
  but the kernel and <a href="command.htm">command.com</a> will
  not be copied to the destination.

Switches:

  <b>/K <i>filename</i></b>
  Gives the <i>filename</i> of the kernel file to be copied. This option
  is only required when the kernel is not called "kernel.sys"

  <b>/L <i>segment</i></b>
  The load <i>segent</i>, in hexadecimal, to use. The default is 60.
