<h2>Examples:</h2>
<p>To display the complete directory hierarchy of drive C and pause <br />
 after each screenful, run tree specifying C: as the start path and <br />
 pipe its output to the more command:<br />
<br />
<samp> tree C:\ | more </samp>
</p>

<p>To display the directory hierarchy of a subdirectory and have the <br />
 output only use standard ASCII characters (such as for printing or <br />
 sending to someone who may view it without DOS line/box drawing character <br />
 support), specify the subdirectory and the /A switch:<br />
<br />
<samp> tree <i>ASUBDIR</i> /a </samp>
</p>

<p>To display the structure of a directory tree and the files within <br />
 each directory, add the /F switch:<br />
<br />
<samp> tree /f | more </samp>
