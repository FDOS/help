  WHICH is a utility born in the UNIX world that enables users to find
  executable files in directories listed in the PATH ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLE. See <a href="../batch/set.htm">SET</a> / <a href="../command/environm.htm">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE</a>.
  WHICH searches for the specified command(s) the same way as if it
  would be specified on command line as command itself. If an executable
  file is found, its path is displayed in this format:
    command "tab" path
  The "tab" stands for the tabulator character (ASCII 9).
  If the command is not found only the command part, but neither a path
  nor the "tab" is displayed.
  Internal commands, installable commands and aliases are not found.
  WHICH is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work.
</pre>
