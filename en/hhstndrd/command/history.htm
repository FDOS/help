<h1>Command: history</h1>
<pre>
  HISTORY displays the history of commands entered at the
  command line, or changes the maximum size of this history.
  You can use the commands once more by typing the key
  "ARROW UP" or "ARROW DOWN" at the command line.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  HISTORY [size] [/?]
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  size  Is not yet implemented.
  /?    Shows the help.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  Without "size" the current contents of the command line history
  buffer is displayed.
  With the size, the size of the history buffer is changed.
  THE HISTORY is stored in the context segment (history) of command.com,
  for more information see: <a href="../base/command.htm">COMMAND /E:nnn</a> and <a href="../command/memory.htm">MEMORY</a>.
  HISTORY is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work.
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  HISTORY     Shows the last executed commands.
  HISTORY /?  Shows the help.
  ARROW UP    Shows the last executed command. Press ENTER and it will
              be executed again. If you press ARROW UP several times you
              will see that a lot of last commands are stored. Simply
              stop and click ENTER when you have the correct one.
  ARROW DOWN  You were too fast with clicking on ARROW UP? Simply click
              ARROW DOWN and you come back!
