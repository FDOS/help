<h1>Command: dir</h1>
<pre>
  DIR displays the contens of the directory
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  1. DIR [{ options | pattern }]
  2. DIR  [drive][path][filename][/P] [/W] [/A[[:]attributes]]
    [/O[[:]sortorder]] [/S] [/B] [/L] [/Y] [/?]
      drive     The drive letter, e.g. C:
      path      The directory, e.g. \example\
      filename  The file to display, e.g. test.txt
                [drive][path][filename]
                Specify drive, directory, and/or files to list. (Could
                be enhanced file specification or multiple filespecs.)
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /A:   (All) Wildcards are matched against System and Hidden files, too.
  /A**: (Attribute) Wildcards are matched against files with selected
        attributes set or clear. The argument of the /A option is a
        sequence of:
        ?  meaning: attribute ? must be set, or
        -? meaning: attribute ? must not be set.
    The following attributes, the ? above, are supported:
        r | -r  Read-only files             -r Files that are not
                                               read-only
        h | -h  Hidden files                -h Files that are not hidden
        s | -s  System files                -s Files that are not system
                                               files
        d | -d  Directories                 -d Directories
        a | -a  Files with the archive      -a Files without the archive
                bit                            bit
  /B    (Bare) Displays the lines with the information of files and
        directories only. The ones displaying the volume label, the
        serial number, totals etc. are suppressed. In combination with
        /S the absolute path of the files is displayed.
  /L    (Lower-case) Filenames are displayed in lower-case letters
        rather than capitol ones.
  /O:   (Order default) is a synonym of /ONG.
  /O**: (Order) Sort the entries displayed in a specific order. The
        following sort orders are supported:
        d | -d  By date and time            -d Date/time reverse order.
        e | -e  By file extension A-Z       -e File extension (Z-A)
        g | -g  Group directories first     -g Group directories last.
        n | -n  By file name A-Z            -n By file name (Z-A)
        s | -s  By size (smallest-biggest)  -s By size (biggest-smallest)
        u       (unsorted)
  Each sort order, except U, may be prefixed by a hyphen to reverse the
  sort order. U effectively cancels any previous setting or specified
  sort order, e.g. to override an /O option from the DIRCMD <a href="../command/environm.htm">ENVIRONMENT</a>
  <a href="../command/environm.htm">VARIABLE</a>.
  If the same sort order is specified twice within the same /O option,
  the last one superceeds previous ones; if more than one /O option is
  specified, the last one superceeds all previous ones.
  Warning: The entries are cached within memory before displaying them;
  if FreeCOM runs short on memory, to sort is disabled completely or
  the entries are sorted in chunks only.
  /P    (Page) Page the output -- pause the display after issuing one
        screen-full.
  /S    (Subdirectories) Recursively display directories.
  /W    (Wide) Displays five filenames per line and suppress the
        information about the file size, date etc.
  /Y    (Year) Displays a 4-digit year, rather than just two digits.
  /4    (4digit Year) is a synonym of /Y.
  /?    Shows the help.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  DIR displays the contents of direcories and/or the attributes of
  files, whatever the pattern specifies. If no pattern is specified on
  command line, the current working directory is displayed. The actual
  information displayed depends on the specified options and is
  explained below.
  A pattern may contain wildcards, which are expanded against both files
  and directories. To specify a directory is essentially equal to write:
  directory\*.*.
  Unlike options patterns are performed in sequence, that means that if
  two patterns are specified, first all entries matching the first one,
  then all entries matching the second one are displayed; instead of to
  display the matching entries intermixed.
  Before parsing its command line DIR parses any option specified by the
  <a href="../command/environm.htm">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE</a> DIRCMD.
  DIR is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work.
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  Example 1:
    DIR
  Displays the contents of the current directory, but ignores System and
  Hidden files.
  Example 2:
    DIR a* bb* *.txt
  First displays all files, that begin with the letter A; then all
  files, that begin with two letters B, are displayed and at last all
  files with the extension TXT.
  Example 3:
    DIR /w a* b*
    DIR a* /w b*
    DIR a* b* /w
  Because the position of options is not significant, all these
  examples behave the same way and display the matching files in wide
  or also called short form.
