<h1>Command: tdsk</h1>
<pre>
  TDSK (TURBODISK) creates a RAM disk like <a href="../base/rdisk.htm">RDISK</a> and <a href="../base/srdisk.htm">SRDISK</a>. Part of
  memory is set aside to act like a disk drive. Because memory is much
  faster than a real disk drive, RAM disks are very fast, but anything
  stored on them will be lost when the machine is restarted or switched
  off. TDSK supports <a href="../base/jemm386.htm">EMS</a> and <a href="../base/himemx.htm">XMS</a>.

<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  device=tdsk.exe size [[s_sector [files [s_cluster]]]] [/E] [/A|X] [/C]
                       [/M]
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  size    the size of the RAM disk, from 8 to 65534 (in Kilobytes).
  [[s_sector [files [s_cluster]]]]
          Advanced. The size of the sectors, root and clusters
          on the disk.
          Valid values for sector are 32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048.
          Files (in the root direcotry) can be from 1 to 65534.
          Clusters can vary from 1 to 255 (some systems are restricted
          to 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128)
  /E      Forces the use of <a href="../base/himemx.htm">XMS</a> memory.
  /A      Specifies the use of <a href="../base/jemm386.htm">EMS</a> memory.
  /X      Specifies the use of <a href="../base/jemm386.htm">EMS</a> memory.
  /C      Forces use of conventional memory (not ideal, so it is
          generally only recommended for systems without <a href="../base/himemx.htm">XMS</a>/<a href="../base/jemm386.htm">EMS</a> or if
          you are having problems with <a href="../base/himemx.htm">XMS</a>/<a href="../base/jemm386.htm">EMS</a> memory.)
  /I:nnn  nnn=country code. This will show the help in another language.
          Spanish (/I=34), German (/I=49) and English (/I=1) are
          supported.
  /M      Switches the screen output from color to monochrome(redirect-
          able) while in CONFIG.SYS monochrome will be used by default.
  /B      avoids to load TURBODSK if there is at least one hard disk
          available on the system.
  /F      selects the number of FAT copies (1 by default) up to a maxi-
          mum of 2.
  /H      Shows the help.
  /?      Shows the help.

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  Size must be in the range 8 - 65534 KB; valid sectors are from 32 to
  2048 Bytes (in powers f 2), though some DOS versions support 128, 256
  and 512 Bytes only. Files of root may be 1 to 65534 and sectors by
  cluster can vary from 1 to 255 (some systems need a power of 2). Only
  the size is necessary.
  Turbodsk defaults to <a href="../base/himemx.htm">XMS</a> or <a href="../base/jemm386.htm">EMS</a>.
  After installing TURBODSK in <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS</a> it can be run from <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a>
  or the prompt in order to vary the drive size (amount of memory used);
  this also erases the drive's contents. A size 0 can be used to
  completely free the memory occupied by the drive: When using
  conventional memory it is useful to cancel a drive BEFORE resizing.
  When more than one TURBODSK is installed, they can be identified by
  additionally giving the drive letter.
  By default, tdsk tries to use <a href="../base/himemx.htm">XMS</a> or <a href="../base/jemm386.htm">EMS</a>, before trying to use
  conventional memory. Most modern computers have <a href="../base/himemx.htm">XMS</a>.
  Why use a RAM disk?
  Many programs create temporary files, which will be stored in a
  temporary directory specified by an environment variable:
   set temp=c:\temp
  Temporary files are deleted when a program exits anyway. So one of the
  main uses of RAM disks is to hold this temporary directory. This
  increases such programs' performance.
  TDSK has the following <a href="../batch/errorlvl.htm">ERRORLEVEL / EXITCODES</a>:
      0: Disk not defined.
    255: Driver not installed from <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS</a>.
    254: Incorrect drive letter specified.
    253: Attempt to define a drive from within a multitasking
         environment such Windows, DOSSHELL, TASKMAX/TASKMGR, etc.
    252: Syntax error.
  Other values below  128 are related to  the  handle  used  in  both
  the Extended or the Expanded memory.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  IN CONFIG.SYS/FDCONFIG.SYS:
    device(high)=C:\FREEDOS\BIN\tdsk.exe 8096
                   (creates 8096 KB RAM disk)
    tdsk.exe 0     resizes the ramdisk to 0 Byte size
                   (deletes all files)
    tdsk.exe 2048  resizes the ramdisk to 2048 KB size
                   (deletes all files)
