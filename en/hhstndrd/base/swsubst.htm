<h1>Command: join / subst / swsubst</h1>
<pre>
  FreeDOS uses SWSUBST instead of SUBST and JOIN.
  SWSUBST combines subst with join with enhanced options.
  SWSUBST replaces a path by a drive letter so that you have access to
  a path via a drive letter.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  swsubst [option] [command]
  If swsubst is used without specifying a command, the CDS table is
  displayed.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /&num;     View the statistic of JOIN'ed drives in the CDS table.
  /!     Like /&num;; initialize the JOIN-flag, if it differs.
  /f     View non-printable characters hexadecimal.
  /a     View the CDS table after the command.
  /k     Create the paths mentioned within the command.
  /t     Like /k, in SUBST check only, if path exists.
  /_     Dump all attributes within the CDS table.
  /o=&num;   Use this backslash offset, do not calculate itself.
  /x=??  List of drive letters to be ignored while a ::label: search

  Without command: displays the CDS table.
  Commands:
  -                      Initialize all SUBST'ed and JOIND'ed drives.
  --                     Initialize all non-networked drives.
  dr [-]path             Like /u dr [-]path.
  /u dr [-]path          Substitute dr to point to path.
  /j dr [-]path          Join dr into path.
  /d dr | dr /d | dr -   Initialize drive dr (and break SUBST/JOIN).
  /s dr1 dr2             Swap dr1 and dr2.
  /n [dr1 dr2]           Swap unit numbers of the same device driver
                         (Std.: floppies).
  /w dr                  Set <a href="../batch/errorlvl.htm">ERRORLEVEL</a> to the drive letter of drive.
  /m [-]path             Create path including all leading up-directories.
  /c [-]path             Like /m, then chdir into it.
  dr:[+-=]{off,on,phys,net,join,subst,hidden}  Set drive flags directly.
  /q dr:[+-]{phys,net,join,subst,hidden}       Query the drive flags.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  The DOS-standard emulating entities of SWSUBST, SUBST and JOIN, have
  the same command line as DOS's have. But they differ in the following
  points:
    - The specified path will be make'ed, including the full path to it,
      e.g. "SUBST c: d:/blah/humpf" creates the path "d:\blah\humpf",
      regardless of if d:\blah exists.
    - You are allowed to break off relations on the fly, that means:
      an already SUBST'ed can be re-SUBST'ed or re-JOIN'ed without
      further note/warning.
    - You are allowed to process a drive with itself, e.g.: "JOIN a:
      a:\blah"
    - The table dump is different, swsubst prints "X: =&gt; Y:\PATH" instead
      of "X: is joined to Y:\PATH".
    - You cannot rename the executables SUBST and JOIN.
    - It won't test the DOS version, unless it's necessary for adjusting
      different data structure sizes.
  If you need SUBST or JOIN simply execute: "copy SWSUBST.EXE JOIN.EXE
  or SUBST.EXE".
  An <a href="../batch/errorlvl.htm">ERRORLEVEL</a> between 65 (ASCII 'A') and 90 (ASCII 'Z') indicates OK
  and the drive letter itself; whereas an <a href="../batch/errorlvl.htm">ERRORLEVEL</a> of zero indicates,
  that there is no such drive; and other <a href="../batch/errorlvl.htm">ERRORLEVELS</a> indicate an error.
