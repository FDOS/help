<h1>Command: graphics, graphics, graph-ps, graphpin, graph-hp</h1>
<pre>
  GRAPHICS allows PrtScr to print graphics screens. (CGA/EGA/VGA/MCGA,
  on PostScript, ESC/P Epson 8/24pin and HP PCL printers)

</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  GRAPH-PS (options) - for laser printers only (PostScript)
  GRAPHPIN (options) - for dot matrix printers and other ESC/P (Epson)
  GRAPH-HP (options) - for HP PCL 3 printers
  Options see below.

  It is recommend that you copy the file that fits
  YOUR printer to GRAPHICS.COM for better overview.
  Run the GRAPH*.COM that fits your printer - It will stay resident in
  the background until you reboot. You can use the 'shift PrtScr' key
  while GRAPH... is resident to print hardcopies (screenshots) of your
  graphical screen contents in all standard CGA, EGA and VGA modes.
  No support for high resolution modes / VESA / Hercules yet. The print
  canvas should fit both A4 and letter paper. The screen is printed in
  landscape mode: The bottom of the screen is at the left of the paper.

  Make sure that you run only versions that match your type of printer.
  Otherwise, the print screen key will cause lots of nonsense to be
  printed: You can abort the printing (not in PostScript) by pressing
  'shift print screen' again. In the PostScript versions, this trick
  will only cause the rest of the printout to stay white, but this will
  not save you from printing nonsense on non-PostScript printers.

  Luckily, many 24-pin printers and even Epson ink jet color printers
  are compatible to Epson. When in doubt, you can always turn off the
  printer and/or reboot the PC before too much paper is wasted.
  Accidentally sending PostScript to printers that cannot handle it
  looks less weird than sending Epson code to other printers
  (PostScript only uses plain text commands).
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /B - process the CGA background color setting
  /I - inverse printing (useful if lots of dark areas on screen, to
       save ink / toner: will print black where screen is white etc.)
  /C - compatibility mode: 120x60 dpi 24 pin
       (instead of 180x180 dpi 24 pin) in Epson case,
       HP Laserjet extra compatibility in PostScript case,
       300 dpi instead of 600 dpi in HP PCL case
  /9 - 9 pin, Epson only: 120x72 dpi, or 60x72 dpi in compatibility mode
  /X - Epson only: send print data for whole lines instead of in blocks
  /R - use random dither instead of ordered dither (not for PostScript)
  /E - economy mode: only 50&percnt; of the density. Done by reducing the
       distance of every color to white to 50&percnt; of the normal value
  /1 - use LPT1 (default is to use LPT1)
  /2 - use LPT2 (default is to use LPT1)
  /3 - use LPT3 (you already guessed it)
  /? - show help screen instead of going resident
     - you do not need to give any options :-)

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  PostScript version:
  GRAPH-PS produces PostScript output for laser printers, assuming that
  the laser printer can make some sense of 256 gray level images itself.
  If you press print screen again while print data is generated, the
  part of the screen that is not already processed will be printed in
  white. Canvas size is 9.9 x 7.43 inch, should fit A4 and letter paper.

  HP PCL version:
  GRAPH-HP is for 600dpi and 300dpi printing on HP PCL 3 compatible
  printers, like HP Ink-jets. This by default uses EconoFast (at 300dpi),
  and depletion (can be selected at compile time). You can select either
  "random" or "ordered" dither as described below. Output looks somewhat
  different, however, as "regular pattern avoidance" code is different
  in HP PCL and Epson modes. Canvas size of 7.2 x 9.6 inch should fit
  both 8.25 x 11.7 inch A4 and 8.5 x 11 inch letter size paper.
  No color printing or RET (up to 4 intensity levels per color / black
  channel) is supported currently. Tell me if you want colors!

  Epson version:
  GRAPHPIN is for 180dpi and 120x60dpi printing on Epson compatible dot
  matrix printers. If you do not select the /R option, dithering patterns
  will be based on a bit-mirrored counter, while the /R option enables
  "random" dither using a linear congruential pseudo random number
  generator, using both low and high byte of the random number to print
  a black pixel with probability equal to the darkness of the
  corresponding screen pixel.

  If you do not understand this tech-speak, look at epson.png: The left
  image is "ordered", the right image is "random". For space reasons,
  epson.png only shows about 100x100 pixels of an MCGA picture. The
  full printed screenshots will use a canvas independent of the screen
  resolution: 1320x1760 (padded to ...x1776) black and white pixels
  (less in 120x72 dpi of course, 1330x1776 with OLDRES compile option).

  You can use my pin-read utility for Linux to convert printer data
  (only 180x180 dpi currently) into images, I provide it in the "extra"
  subdirectory of the sources. If you press print screen again while
  printing is in progress, printing will abort at the next available
  position (a few 100 per screenshot) and some message like "aborted"
  will be printed to tell you about it.

  Current canvas size is 7.6 (120x60) or 7 7/9 (60x72, 120x72, 180x180)
  by 9 7/9 inch. It should fit both 8.25 x 11.7 A4 and 8.5 x 11 letter.

  With OLDRES, 120x72 dpi images are 6.2 x 8.2 inch landscape mode,
  and 180x180 dpi and PostScript images are 7.43 x 9.9 inch landscape
  mode. This was to make sure that 120x60 dpi (24 pin printers in
  compatibility mode) still fit the page.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  graphics /9 /1    (driver is loaded) OR:
  graph-ps /c /1     OR
  graph-hp /c /e /1
  After loading the driver you can print screenshots using "Shift
  PrintScreen" even in graphics mode. Use the correct printer driver!
