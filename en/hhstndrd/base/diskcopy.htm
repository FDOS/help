<h1>Command: diskcopy</h1>
<pre>
  DISKCOPY copies the contents of a floppy disk to a second floppy.
  It currently supports disk copies for almost any diskette type
  including 160 Kb, 180 Kb, 320 Kb, 360 Kb, 720 Kb, 1.2 MB, 1.44 MB
  and 2.88 MB disks, using XMS, EMS, buffers or swap file. On top of
  that diskcopy supports the use of image files.
  The images can be used by <a href="../base/shsufdrv.htm">SHSUFDRV</a>.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  Diskcopy [source][destination][/a][/v][/m][/i][/o][/1][/x][/d][/r]
           [/f][/t][/?]
    source:       drive or image file to copy from.
    destination:  drive or image file to copy to.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /a  Give an audible warning for user action.
      This option gives a beep each time user action is required.
  /v  Verify reads and writes. With this option enabled reads and writes
      are verified. Notice that using this option takes twice as long as
      without it. The DOS verify  flag is not influenced by this option.
  /m  Only use memory for disk copy. With this option only memory is
      used for the diskcopy, meaning either XMS, EMS or buffers.
  /i  Show memory usage (informative).
      Tells you which kind of memory is used.
  /o  Overwrite destination, if it already exists (in case of an image
      file). When you want to make an image file of a floppy disk and
      a file with that name already exists the program refuses to
      overwrite the file. With this option you can change this behaviour
      and force an overwrite of existing files.
  /x  Always automaticaly exit. This switch makes sure the program
      always exits. You will most likely notice this at the end of the
      program. If you use this switch the program will no longer ask you
      wether you want another copy of the disk.
  /d  Assume disk already in drive. This switch is used to speed up disk
      copying. The program will not ask you to insert the source or
      destination diskette if possible.
  /r  Go into disk error recovery mode.
      Sometimes part of a disk is unreadable, but everything else is
      still valid. In those cases you might want to copy the disk to a
      new disk, while recovering as much data as possible. Using this
      switch you can force diskcopy to scan more effectively for media
      errors on the disk and recover more of the disk than is possible
      without the switch.
      This option is not available, if you compile diskcopy to always be
      in error recovery mode.
  /f  Perform fast diskcopy (only copy filled sectors).
      Using this option only the sectors which are filled are copied
      resulting in a much faster way of making a disk copy. Notice
      however that the copy of the target disk in this case is not
      exactly the same as that of the original. All files on the disk
      will however be identical to those on the original disk.
      This option is also used to make small image files. These image
      files will then contain only the information of sectors which
      contain data. If you write the image file back to a disk the disk
      will not be identical to the first disk, but all files will be
      the same.
  /t  Don't ask target disk if copying image file to same disk.
      When copying an image file to the same disk as the one that is
      being copied, the program normally asks to insert a new disk. When
      using this option the image file is directly written to the disk
      without asking for an other disk.
  /1  This option doesn't do anything but has been included for MS-DOS
      compatibility. In other versions of DOS, this copied the first
      side only.
  /?  Shows the help.

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  A minus sign after an option disables the option.
  If the source and/or destination is a drive, for example
  "a:" then it is treated as a floppy disk, otherwise it is
  treated as an image file.
  The source and destination can be the same drive; DISKCOPY will
  first copy from the source, and then prompt you to swap floppy
  disks. Then it will write to the destination.
  DISKCOPY uses the Linux rawrite format for its image files.
  Therefore the image files from DISKCOPY can be used by
  Rawrite and vice versa.
  DISKCOPY cannot read from or overwrite Linux floppy disks.
  It can, however, write a Linux floppy image to a DOS disk.
  DISKCOPY supports NLS (national language support) and long
  filenames, see a href="../base/doslfn.htm">DOSLFN</a>.
  In order to facilitate using DISKCOPY you can optionally create
  a diskcopy.ini file to store the options you use often.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  Example 1:
    Diskcopy a: a: /a /i
  Copy a floppy disk from a: to a:, give a beep before user action
  and show memory usage.
  Example 2:
    Diskcopy a: example.img
  Copy the contents of the floppy disk in drive a: to the image file
  example.img.
  Example 3:
    Diskcopy example.img a:
  Copy the contents of the file example.img to the floppy disk in
  drive a:
  Example 4:
    Diskcopy example1.img example2.img
  Copy the file example1.img to the file example2.img.
  Example 5:
    Diskcopy a: a: /a-
  Copy the contents of the disk in drive a: to another disk in
  drive a:, making sure there is no beep for user action.
  Example 6:
    Diskcopy a: a:a /f
  Create a small image file of drive a: on drive a:
  Notice that in this case:
    -  The program can give an out of memory error if the entire
       contents can not be copied in one time.
    -  The resulting file "a" is not included in the image file.
  Example 6:
    Diskcopy a:a a:, or identically: diskcopy a:a a: /f
  Copy the image file "a" on drive a: to drive a:
  Notice that in this case:
    -  The user will be asked to insert a new floppy.
  Example 7:
    Diskcopy a:a a: /t
    Copy the image file "a" on drive a: to drive a:
    Notice that in this case:
    -  The contents of drive a: is overwritten. So the image file is
       gone too!
