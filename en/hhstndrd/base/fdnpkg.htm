<h1>Command: fdnpkg (substitute for fdpkg)</h1>
<pre>
  FDNPKG is network-enabled package manager for DOS. FDNPKG is released
  under the MIT license. It allows to install/remove/update software on
  a compatible DOS system using remote or local repositories. Remote
  (online) repositories can be either http or gopher URLs. FDNPKG is
  written by Mateusz Viste, primarily for the FreeDOS (tm) Project, but
  it can be used on other DOS systems as well. FDNPKG comes with a
  lightweight tool called <a href="../base/fdinst.htm">FDINST</a> that is suitable for old, pre-386
  systems with low amounts of memory. FDINST doesn't provide network
  support. FDNPKG stands for "FreeDOS Network Package manager".
  <b>FDNPKG is the substitute for FDPKG.</b>

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  FDNPKG is handling FreeDOS packages. A "package" is an archive
  containing software in its binary and/or source code form. FreeDOS
  packages are in fact standard ZIP files that contain a predefined
  directory tree (eg. BIN/, SOURCE/, DOC/...). FDNPKG performs a set
  of tests on the package before trying to install it, and refuses to
  install packages that seem to be invalid.
  The ZIP format is a container that allows for multiple compression
  algorithms to be used. FDNPKG supports these: stored files (no
  compression), deflate and lzma.

  Configuration:
  The FDNPKG configuration file is a text file that contains various
  directives, like repositories declarations, cache time, etc. I won't
  describe the configuration file here, because it's pretty well
  commented itself. FDNPKG looks for its configuration file into
  &percnt;DOSDIR&percnt;\BIN\FDNPKG.CFG by default, but you can make FDNPKG use a
  configuration file at any other location, by setting the FDNPKG.CFG
  environnement variable.
  Example:
    SET FDNPKG.CFG=C:\MYDIR\FDNPKG.CFG

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  You can find the package.zip files at the FreeDOS live CD at
  \Packages\APPS or ARCHIVER etc. OR at:
  <b>https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/repositories/</b>
  Type:
    fdnpkg install tar.zip (or another one).
  To uninstall type:
    fdnpkg remove tar (not tar.zip or another one).
