<h1>Command: keyb</h1>
<pre>
  KEYB is a localization BIOS extension for DOS.
  KEYB can be considered as a keyboard driver which intercepts the
  keyboard management BIOS routines in order to adapt non-US keyboards
  to the system, and provides other facilities.
  (NOTE: KEYB is not a proper device driver, and is not loaded with
  DEVICE= in <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS / FDCONFIG.SYS</a>; you run it as a resident
  program instead).
  Required data is read from a keyboard layout data file like
  KEYBOARD.SYS/KEYBRD2/3/4.sys (see link KEYB_LAY below) OR a KL file.
  A  KL keyboard layout is identified by two labels, a string label,
  which is mandatory (usually a two letter string, such as GR, FR or SP),
  and an optional numeric identifier to distinguish different variants.
  You can create .KL files by running KC (link to packet see below)
  and using the KEY files from KEYB-LAYOUT. KEY files from XKEYB
  do NOT WORK!
  FreeDOS has three keyboard drivers: KEYB, <a href="../base/mkeyb.htm">MKEYB</a>, and <a href="../base/xkeyb.htm">XKEYB</a>.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  KEYB  layoutName[,[CP][,filename]]  [/ID:nnn]  [/E] [/9] [/I] [/Dx]
                  [/V] [/L=m] [/NOHI] [/B] [/S]
  KEYB [/U]
  KEYB /?
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  Parameterless KEYB will show information on the currently loaded KEYB.
  LayoutName    A physical layout identifier, such as GR or SP.
  /ID:nnn       Specifies the numeric identifier nnn.
  CP            Codepage in which you want KEYB to start (if omitted,
                DISPLAY.SYS and the system are checked).
  filename      The KL file that contains the information for the given
                layout, or the compilation file where the information
                resides. If it is omitted, then <b>KEYBOARD.SYS</b> is tried,
                otherwise <b>LayoutName.KL</b>.
  /E            Specifies that the keyboard is an AT enhanced keyboard
                (this switch is incompatible with /9).
  /9            Specifies that int9h management services must be
                activated (this switch is incompatible with /E).
  /CAPSLOCK=ON|OFF  Enables or disables Caps Lock
  /I            Forces the installation over an already existing
                keyboard driver.
  /Dx           Sets the decimal separator character to x.
  /U            Unloads a KEYB previously loaded in memory.
  /V            Verbose: Shows extra information.
  /L=m          Forces the usage of submapping to m, provided that it
                is compatible with current codepage.
  /NOHI         Avoids KEYB to load data into high memory, by loading
                it below 640Kb.
  /NOUMB        Avoids KEYB to load data into upper memory.
  /NUMLOCK=ON|OFF  Enables or disables Num Lock
  /B            Disables sound alerts (Beep).
  /S            Safemode: does not allow un-closed keyboard layout
                collections and blocks strings and other critical
                commands.
  /SCROLLLOCK=ON|OFF  Enables or disables Scroll Lock
  /?            Shows the help.

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  You can program FreeDOS so that keyboard is  configured  at boot
  time by means of <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT / FDAUTO.BAT</a>.
  Append the command line into your AUTOEXEC.BAT to do this.
  You can create your own customized layout files by using the compiler
  tool KC200x. See link below. KC comes with the following tools:
    KC       Is the KEY language Keyboard descriptor files compiler.
             KC takes a source keyboard language descriptor file (in KEY
             language) and converts it into a bare KeybCB or a KL file
             to be used with FD-KEYB.
    KEYCODE  Helps you scan the output of the keyboard driver.
    KLIB     Is a librarian for KL files: groups KL files into a single
             library file. KLIB allows you to create libraries, list,
             add and remove KL files inside a library, and finally to
             make it no longer editable (close it).
  FD-KEYB is compatible with the <a href="../batch/errorlvl.htm">ERRORLEVEL / EXITCODES</a> of MS-KEYB.
  However, as a large number of possible error causes is considered, an
  alternative numeration of errors is shown on screen at load time.

</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
    KEYB SP,858
      Loads KEYB with the layout for the Spanish distribution and
      codepage 858. For being able to load it search for the
      settings in (<a href="../other/kpdos.htm">KPDOS</a>) first.
      The KEYBOARD files are in packet KEYB_LAY, link see above.
      SP,858 is found at C:\FREEDOS\BIN\KEYBOARD.SYS then.
      KEYBRD2/3/4.SYS for other countries have to be mentioned
      explicitely, see turkish example below!

    KEYB GR,,C:\FREEDOS\BIN\PATH TO KL FILES\GR.KL /E (CP 858!)
    KEYB GR,850,C:\FREEDOS\BIN\PATH TO KL FILES\GR.KL (CP 850!)
      Loads the German keyboard layout for KEYB, explicitely informing
      KEYB that we are using an enhanced keyboard.
      Use this if KEYB cannot identify the presence of an enhanced
      keyboard. Please check for .KL file, they are in:
      NOWHERE, but if you need them have a closer look at kc200x.zip,
      LINK see above.

  In special cases you have to check <a href="../other/kpdos.htm">KPDOS</a> and to find the correct
  KEYBOARD/KEYBRD2/KEYBRD3/KEYBRD4.SYS files first:

    KEYB TR,857,C:\FREEDOS\BIN\keybrd2.sys /ID:440
      (This is turkish keyboard, see above: It is mentioned at KEYBRD2.
      SYS, with values: tr440 (/ID:440)  857 (first value), 858, 850,
      853  EGA).

  Turkish offers Q-Type and F-Type. The other version can be used by:
    KEYB TR,857,C:\FREEDOS\BIN\keybrd2.sys
      values: tr (no /ID:440!!)  857 (first value), 858, 850, 853  EGA.
