<h1>Command: lptdrv</h1>
<pre>
  LPTDRV is a driver for computer LPT ports (parallel "CENTRONICS"). It
  allows to change easily the logic states of any pins, either manually
  or automatically (on a predefined time basis).
  With a small electronic circuit we can for example drive electric
  devices trought the PC. The program can support max. 24 devices and
  3 LPT ports (0x287, 0x387 and 0x3BC). There is no need to build an
  additional electronic circuit for small power devices like LEDs
  (10-20mA), but for bigger projects (motors, etc.), the circuit
  is needed.

  LPTDRV works with a user interface.
  With LPTDRV.CFG you can program LPTDRV to work by itself. You have to
  enter at least one time variable, the port and the pin (D0..D7) which
  will have to change. The syntax is as following:
  DD,MM,YYYY,hh,mm,ss,P,D,S

  Where DD is the day of the month, MM is the month, YYYY is the year,
  hh the hour, mm the minutes, ss the seconds, P the port to affect (1
  for 0x3BC, 2 for 0x387, 3 for 0x287), D the pin (0 to 7) and S the
  state to force (1 for High or 0 for Low). If you don't want for example
  to enter a specific month and year (to have a daily cycle), enter -1
  for month and year.
