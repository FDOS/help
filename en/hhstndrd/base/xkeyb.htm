<h1>Command: xkeyb / xkeybres</h1>
<pre>
  XKEYB is a keyboard driver with a certain resemblance to the
  well-known <a href="../base/keyb.htm">KEYB</a>. <b>It supports the .key format.</b>
  FreeDOS has three keyboard drivers: <a href="../base/keyb.htm">KEYB</a>, <a href="../base/mkeyb.htm">MKEYB</a> and XKEYB.
  The .KEY files of XKEYB and KEYB are NOT compatible!
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  xkeyb configuration file[.KEY] [/Xnn] [/Q] [/U] [/I] [/E][/?]
    whereas configuration file is the country code ("GR.key" or "US.key")
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /Xnn  This switch should be used to explicitly set the amount of
        storage space to be reserved for XStrings (where nn is the
        memory-size indicated in bytes).
  /Q    (Quiet), suppresses the output of LIST paragraph in configuration
        files.
  /U    (Uninstall), removes the resident copy from XKeyb from memory
        (if installed).
  /E    Maps extended (E0-prefixed) keys to their corresponding normal
        key
  /I    Forces the installation, ignoring the current driver
  /?    Shows the help
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  As with <a href="../base/keyb.htm">KEYB</a>, XKEYB is also a keyboard driver for MS-DOS computers,
  which is installed as a memory-resident program and can be configured
  for different countries using parameters.
  However XKEYB allows many more configuration options than <a href="../base/keyb.htm">KEYB</a>. Thus,
  you can configure XKEYB not only for different countries, but also for
  your own personal preferences.
  On the one hand XKEYB permits the free allocation of all keys on all
  levels (normally with SHIFT, CTRL, ALT, and CTRL-ALT), while on the
  other hand it offers the flexibility to define character strings to
  individual keys on certain levels.
  Furthermore for each key it can be determined separately whether it is
  influenced by CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK or SCROLL LOCK, and if the SHIFT,
  CTRL, and ALT keys determine what values are issued.
  The programmer is provided with a PI (Program Interface) to XKEYB.
  It allows access to many of the XKEYB functions.
  XKEYB comes with the packet XKEYB. It contains the related commands:
    XKEYBRES     Alternative version of XKEYB with smaller resident size
                 (source only, in source package)
    KEYMAN       KEYMAN is an interactive macro recorder for use with
                 XKEYB. Either XKEYB or XKEYBRES must be resident in
                 memory before KEYMAN can be installed (and XKEYBRES
                 must have a configuration file allocated by XKEYB).
    LISTXDEF     LISTXDEF is used to output (to STDOUT) the definition
                 file currently being used by XKeyb (including any keys
                 defined using KEYMAN.EXE). It is most commonly used to
                 save a custom definition file (ie. one created by
                 loading one of the standard definition files with XKEYB
                 then assigning additional macros using KEYMAN).
    SCANKBD      Program for scanning current keyboard layout.
