<h1>Command: sort</h1>
<pre>
  Sort is used to sort the input file. Lines of input are taken from
  the file named on the sort command or if no file is given, input is
  taken from standard input.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  sort [/R] [/N] [/+num] [/A] [/?] [drive][path]filename
  command | sort [/R] [/N] [/A] [/+num] [/?]
       drive     The drive letter, e.g. C:
       path      The directory, e.g. \example\
       filename  The driver (file) to load, e.g. unordered.txt
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /R     Sort in reverse order (Z - A).
  /A     Sort by ASCII, instead of <a href="../cnfigsys/country.htm">COUNTRY</a> sort order.
  /N     Enables NLS (national language support).
  /+num  Start sorting with column num in each line of text. Default=1.
  /?     Shows the help.
  /?     Shows the help.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  SORT does not change the input file, only the output.
  SORT supports NLS (national language support).
  Known bugs:
  This version of sort only uses conventional ram and does not do
  an out-of-memory sort, so it is limited to what can fit in available
  memory. The maximum record length is 1000 characters and the maximum
  number of records that can be sorted is 10,000. This does not mean
  that you will be able to sort 10,000 records of 1000 characters each,
  since you would run out of memory before you read all of the data in.
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  Example 1:
    dir | sort
  Displays the current directory in alphabetical order (A-Z):
    dir | sort /r
  Displays the current directory in reverse order (Z-A):
  When the simple "dir" command has pauses while showing all files, the
  sort command also expects these pauses (and several space bars), shows
  NOTHING till the last space bar is pressed. Please keep this in mind.
  Example 2:
    sort file1 OR:
    sort &lt;file1
  Sorts the contents of file1 using the entire line as the sort key.
  Example 3:
    sort /R /+21 &lt;file1
  Sorts file1 in reverse order (Z-A) based on the key starting in
  column 21.
  Example 4:
    sort /+2 c:\tmp\foobar.dat &gt;b:\data.out
  Sorts c:\tmp\foobar.dat using the key in column 2 and put the output
  on a file called data.out residing on the B: floppy drive.
  Example 5:
  In command line:
    sort           -ENTER-  (alternative: sort /+2)
    this           -ENTER-
    is             -ENTER-
    a              -ENTER-
    short          -ENTER-
    sentence       -ENTER-
  (CTRL-Z)          Exits the command and executes it.
  <b>PLEASE CHECK IF "Z" IS SHOWN at CTRL-Z, otherwise it will not exit</b>
  <b>and execute the command!</b>
   (No /+2) gives out :   (With /+2) sorted by second letter per line:
    a                      a        ("a")
    is                     sentence ("e")
    sentence               this     ("h"i)
    short                  short    ("h"o)
    this                   is       ("s")
