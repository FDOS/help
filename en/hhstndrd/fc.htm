<h1>fc</h1>
Compares two files or sets of files, displaying the differences between the two.
<pre>
   <b>fc [d:][path]file1 [d:][path]file2 [options]</b> 
</pre>
Compares file1 to file2.
<h2>Options</h2>
<pre>
  <b>/A</b>
  Displays the first and last lines of differences only

  <b>/B</b>
  Compares binary files

  <b>/C</b>
  Ignore case

  <b>/L</b>
  Compare text files

  <b>/LB</b><i>n</i>
  Set the maximum number of consecutive different ASCII lines to <i>n</i>

  <b>/Mn</b>
  Set the maximum number of differences between binary files
  to report, before aborting.
  The default value is 20.
  Use 0 to allow an unlimited number of differences.

  <b>/N</b>
  Display the line numbers (text files only)

  <b>/S</b>
  Scan files in subdirectories as well

  <b>/T</b>

  <b>/W</b>

</pre>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>FC defaults to binary mode for files .EXE, .COM, .SYS, .OBJ, .BIN and .LIB.
<li>By default the binary compare stops after 20 differences but that value can
be modified through the /M switch. /M0 means "unlimited differences".
/M is interpreted as /M0.
<li>A design limitation of this program is that, in the text mode file
comparison, only the first 32765 lines are compared; the remaining lines are
ignored. The line length is virtually unlimited.
