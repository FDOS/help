   <b>pushd [directory]
   popd</b>
</pre>
<p>
pushd is a lot like <a href="cd.htm">cd</a>, except that it stores
the current directory before changing it. Later on, popd can be
used to restore it. pushd can be used several times, storing a stack
of directories.</p>
<p>Using pushd without specifying a directory will store the current
directory, but not change it.</p>
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
this command            changes the current directory to:
============            ================================
cd c:\fdos\bin                    c:\fdos\bin
pushd c:\games                     c:\games
pushd c:\utils                     c:\utils
popd                               c:\games
popd                              c:\fdos\bin
</pre>
