<h1>break</h1>
Turns the extended Ctrl+C check ON or OFF.
<pre>
   <b>break [ON|OFF]</b>
</pre>
<p>The default is <b>OFF</b>, so FreeDOS only checks Ctrl+C during screen output,
print and keyboard operations. When the extended option is <b>ON</b>, Ctrl+C
will be checked during disk operations as well.</p>

<p>Ctrl+C is used to end program execution.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
If no arguments are named, the current status (<b>ON</b> or <b>OFF</b>) is shown.
