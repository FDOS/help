<h1>shsuCDx</h1>
<pre>
   shsucdx [/D:<b>driver</b>[,<b>drive</b>][,<b>unit</b>],[<b>maxNumDrives</b>]] [switches]
</pre>
<p>The driver-to-DOS extender for CD drives. Use this (and a CD driver)
so that CD drives can be accessed from DOS.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<pre>
   <b>driver</b>
   The alias of the CD driver, which is specified when the driver
   is loaded. See below, <a href="#driver">Loading a CD driver</a>.

   <b>drive</b>
   The first CD drive will be assigned to this drive letter, then
   subsequent drive letters will be used for any other CD drives
   that are detected.

   <b>unit</b>
   Selects the first drive unit of those detected to be assigned to a
   drive letter. This is a number from 0 to 99.
  
   <b>maxNumDrives</b>
   shsucdx will not assign more than this many drives to drive letters.

Switches:

   <b>/C</b>
   Uses conventional instead of high memory

   <b>/U</b>
   Unloads the shsucdx driver from memory

   <b>/&tilde;</b>  Toggle tilde operation
   <b>/&tilde;+</b> Switch tilde operation on
   <b>/&tilde;-</b> Switch tilde operation off
   Filenames on CD drives can be longer than DOS names, which
   are restricted to 8 plus 3 for the extension. Shsucdx takes
   the first 8 characters before the dot, and the first 3 after,
   and discards the rest.
   With tilde operation ON, shsucdx will use tildes to distinguish
   between long file names that would have the same name when
   shortened to an 8.3 DOS filename.
</pre>
<p>Note that shsucdx will only detect drives that are compatible with the specified driver.</p>
<h2>Where can I get a CD driver from?</h2>
<p>For IDE CD-ROM drives (most common) FreeDOS includes <a href="atapicdd.htm">ATAPICDD.SYS</a>
(still in the development stage though).
You may have a driver on your CD Drive's installation disk, or on the manufacturer's website.
There are also various clone and generic drivers on the internet.</p>
<a name="driver"><h2>Loading a CD driver</h2></a>
You will need to load the driver in your <a href="cnfigsys/index.htm">config.sys</a> file
before using it with shsucdx. For example:
<pre>
   <a href="cnfigsys/device.htm">DEVICE</a>=MYCDDRV.SYS /D:SHSU001
</pre>
Please refer to your driver's instructions for details on installation.<br><br>
SHSU001 is the driver alias that will be given to shsucdx. It can be any alphanumeric name
between 1 and 8 characters long.
