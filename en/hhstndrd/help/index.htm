<h1>How to use AMB / the FreeDOS Help (hhstndrd 1.1.0 en)</h1>
<pre>
  There are two user interfaces that support the help:
  <a href="../help/amb.htm">AMB</a> and <a href="../help/help.htm">HTMLHELP</a>. Both are easy to handle.

  Using the <a href="../base/ctmouse.htm">CTMOUSE</a> (Cutemouse) mouse driver:
  * Topic Links are highlighted in Yellow in (<a href="../help/help.htm">HTMLHELP</a>).
    In <a href="../help/amb.htm">AMB</a> they are highlighted in Green.
    In the internet they are marked as usual.
  * Click on a Link to see more on that topic. In <a href="../help/amb.htm">AMB</a> you have
    to doubleclick to open the link.
  * Links that lead to the internet do not work as the browser does
    not support this.
  * Click on the scroll-bar to scroll the page up and down (same in AMB).
  * Quit Help by clicking on "Alt+X Exit" at the top of the screen
    (or press ALT-X at the keyboard). In <a href="../help/amb.htm">AMB</a> type ESC.
  * Click on "F1 Help on Help" or on "Help on Help" at <a href="../help/help.htm">HTMLHELP</a>.
    In <a href="../help/amb.htm">AMB</a> doublecklick on "Help on Help" on the top of the first
    site.
  * More navigation is provided at the bottom of the screen
    (not in <a href="../help/amb.htm">AMB</a>).

  Using the <a href="../base/keyb.htm">KEYBOARD</a> in <a href="../help/help.htm">HTMLHELP</a>:
  * Use the arrow keys (or TAB) to highlight a topic, then press enter.
  * Page Up and Page Down scroll the help information.
  * Alt+X exits help. (Alt+F4 works too.)
  * Alt+Left Arrow goes back a topic. (Escape, Alt+B and Backspace
    work too.)
  * Alt+Right Arrow goes forward a topic. (Alt+F works too.)
  * Alt+C returns to the contents page.
  * "F1" button or "Help on Help" gives this help screen.
  * There are also other ways of scrolling the help information on
    screen. Home and End move to the very top and bottom of the document.
    Holding Alt while pressing the up and down arrow keys scrolls the
    help gradually.

  Using the <a href="../base/keyb.htm">KEYBOARD</a> in <a href="../help/amb.htm">AMB</a>:
  * Use the arrow keys (or TAB) to highlight a topic, then press enter.
  * Page Up and Page Down scroll the help information. You can also use
    arrow up / down.
  * Use ESC to come back or to exit program.
