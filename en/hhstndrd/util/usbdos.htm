  All Device/Interfaces have General Descriptors, and all Device/Inter-
  face Drivers need to download the General Descriptors in order to
  configure and control the Device/Interfaces. All of the DOS USB Drivers
  have options to let you view the Descriptors of the Device/Interfaces
  it is controlling. You can view the Descriptors just for casual
  interest, or because something is not working correctly and you need
  to do some troubleshooting. It actually takes quite a bit of
  programming to decode and print the various Descriptors in an under-
  standable fashion. So, rather than "copying" everything it takes to do
  that into every single program that needs it, it is much easier and
  more efficient to create a separate program (or set of programs)
  dedicated to that purpose. When a Device/Interface Driver needs to
  decode and print a Descriptor for you to view, it just "calls" the
  Support Program instead of trying to do it internally.
  In these DOS USB Drivers, the program that actually decodes the General
  Descriptors is called USBSUPT1 (USB SUPporT program &num;1). In turn, the
  Support Program USBSUPT1 at various times may call other "sub-support"
  programs, such as VENDORID (which translates USB or PCI Vendor ID's
  into Vendor Names) and UNI2ASCI (which translates Unicode strings into
  ASCII strings). Of course, USBSUPT1 isn't the only program that may
  need the functions contained in the "sub-support" programs, which is
  why they are not "embedded" into USBSUPT1. The Support Programs can be
  called by any other program that wants to use them, not necessarily
  just the ones contained in this DOS USB package.
  The Support Programs are written as stand-alone DOS programs, rather
  than simple "data files" or in some "special" format that can only be
  read or executed in some unique way. This allows you, if you want, to
  run the Support Programs as a separate, stand-alone programs, and
  discern all sorts of interesting things about the USB structure and
  organization.
  In addition, to Support Programs, there are also several Test Programs
  included in this package. A Test Program is designed to test a specific
  Device/Interface Driver to make sure it is operating properly. An
  example of a Test Program is PS2MTEST (PS2 Mouse TEST), which is
  specifically designed to test USBMOUSE (the USB Mouse Driver). Test
  programs are originally written as part of the program-writing process,
  in order to test and troubleshot all of the features and compati-
  bilities of a Device/Interface Driver. You can use them to test and
  troubleshoot things as well, or you can just "play around" with them
  to see how things work.
