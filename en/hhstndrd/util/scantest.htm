  SCANTEST is a low-level keyboard testing program. It's included here as
  a "companion" program to help you test and configure USBKEYB (discussed
  on page 90 of USBINTRO.DOC, see links below), but you can use it test
  any kind of keyboard. This version of SCANTEST is actually a slightly
  updated version of the SCANTEST that was included with one of my other
  programs (SCANCODE) that was last released several years ago. The
  updates added to this version include descriptions for several of the
  "multimedia" keys on the keyboard (volume controls, CD player play/
  pause, etc.), an indicator for "repeating" keystrokes (typeamatic
  repeats), and support for Long File Names in the output. If you've
  used earlier versions of SCANTEST, the differences are relatively minor
  and will probably not be all that obvious to you.
  When you run SCANTEST, it "intercepts" every keystroke you type from
  the keyboard, and displays the Scan Code of the keystroke (a number or
  a series of numbers), along with a description of the keystroke. Note
  that the description is only valid for United States QWERTY keyboards,
  so if that's not the kind of keyboard you're using, the descriptions
  will probably be different than what you're expecting. The Scan Code
  numbers displayed will always be correct, no matter what kind of
  keyboard you have. To exit the SCANTEST program, simply press "Escape"
  on the keyboard.
  It is important that you realize that SCANTEST is a low-level program,
  and what is displays are the Scan Codes that are coming from the
  keyboard, and are NOT the ASCII characters that usually appear on the
  screen as you are typing. Scan Codes and ASCII characters are
  COMPLETELY different animals, and there is no direct relationship
  between the two. You can read the documentation for my SCANCODE program
  if you want to investigate this further -- we will not discuss it in
  detail here.
  The only option switch SCANTEST provides is the ability to "tee" the
  displayed output to both the screen and to another location (DOS file
  or device) at the same time. For instance, let's say you intend to have
  a long SCANTEST "session", and you would like to remember the entire
  session by sending everything that gets displayed on the screen to the
  printer (LPT1:). To accomplish this, you would start SCANTEST the
  following way:
    SCANTEST LPT1:
  If you do this, everything that SCANTEST displays on the screen will
  also be sent to LPT1:.
  You can "tee" the output to almost any DOS device or file you want to,
  not just the printer. Here are a some examples:
    SCANTEST C:\SCANTEST.TXT
    SCANTEST "C:\My Documents\ScanTest.Out"
  Obviously, the second example above will only work if you're currently
  working in an environment that supports Long File Names (LFN's).
  The one Device that you cannot "tee" the output to is the CON: Device,
  because it is the same thing as the screen. That is, you cannot send
  the output to the screen (CON:), and then try to "tee" the output to
  the same place (the screen or CON:). I can't imagine anybody trying to
  do this (at least not on purpose), but if you do SCANTEST will
  generate an error.
