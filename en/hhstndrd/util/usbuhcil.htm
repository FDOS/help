<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  USBUHCIL is too complex and too long to describe it completely in
  htmlhelp. Please have a look into pages 53 till 175 of USBINTRO.DOC,
  see links below).

  USBUHCI is the full USB Host Controller Driver program. USBUHCIL is the
  "Lite" or "Limited" version. The difference between the two is that
  USBUHCI can handle a full 126 Logical Devices (Addresses), and allows
  Isochronous Transactions to be scheduled. USBUHCIL can only handle 16
  Logical Devices, and does not allow the scheduling of Isochronous
  Transactions. Both programs implement the full Application Programming
  Interface (API) as described in USBAPI.DOC, and are equivalent in every
  other way.
  From now on, when we are referring to one or the other of the programs
  (USBUHCI or USBUHCIL), we will use the name of the individual program.
  When we are referring to a Host Controller Driver in general (and can
  be actually referring to either program), we will use USBUHCI{L}.
  USBUHCIL uses substantially less memory than USBUHCI, and should be
  sufficient for most applications. Most computers only have a few
  Physical Devices plugged into any particular USB bus, and there are no
  Drivers available yet for any type of Isochronous Device/Interface (such
  as a Video Camera). Note, however, that because there has not yet been
  a Device/Interface Driver developed for a "real" Isochronous Device, the
  Isochronous capabilities of USBUHCI have not been tested with an actual
  Physical Device and may not work correctly.
  Both USBUHCI &amp; USBUHCIL require an overlay file to operate properly.
  The overlay file for USBUHCI is called USBUHCI.OVL, and the overlay file
  for USBUHCIL is called USBUHCIL.OVL. The overlay file must be in the
  same directory as the main executable file (USBUHCI.COM or
  USBUHCIL.COM). If USBUHCI{L} cannot find the overlay file (or it is the
  wrong version of overlay file), the program will not work.
