<h1>Command: thrust</h1>
<pre>
  <a href="../util/usbdos.htm">USBDOS</a> is a collection of different USB drivers and tools:
  THRUST returns low-level information (raw numbers) about your game
  port and joysticks. This information will probably not be very useful
  unless you understand how game ports and joysticks really work.

<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  There are two methods THRUST can use to look at your joysticks. Depen-
  ding on your exact hardware and software, one method may work better
  than the other.
  The first method uses the computer's BIOS. If you are using a
  compatible digital joystick driver (like my SDWRGMPD or USBJSTIK
  programs), THRUST will automatically use the BIOS method.
  The second method looks directly at the I/O port hardware. THRUST uses
  the direct hardware method by default if it does not find a compatible
  digital joystick driver installed in memory.
  To have THRUST use a specific method (BIOS or Direct I/O Port access),
  whether there is a compatible digital joystick driver installed or not,
  use an appropriate option on the command line:
    THRUST B                               (force BIOS method)
    THRUST D &num;, THRUST P &num;, or THRUST I &num;  (force DIRECT I/O PORT method)

    The &num; (I/O Port Number) is optional, and can be a decimal
    (512-527) or hexadecimal (200h-20Fh) port number. The default is 201h
    (513), which is the correct port for 99.99&percnt; of all computers.

  THRUST is a program designed to test your joysticks. It does this by
  displaying the low-level, "raw" data that is coming from the joysticks,
  either through the joystick BIOS (software) or directly from the
  joystick (game port) hardware. It's included here as a "companion"
  program to help you test USBJSTIK (discussed directly on page 123
  of USBINTRO.DOC, see links below), but you can also use it to simply
  test your analog joysticks.
  What you will see on the screen when you run THRUST is divided into
  three sections. At the left will be a description of how THRUST is
  currently interacting with the joysticks: using the joystick BIOS
  (software), or by directly using the hardware (in which case USBJSTIK
  will show you an I/O port number).
  The second section will show you the raw data (numbers) being returned
  by each of the four axes (AX, AY, BX, and BY). For each particular
  axis, if you move the appropriate control (handle or direction-pad or
  slider or whatever), the displayed number will change. Usually, moving
  the control left or up or counter-clockwise will make the number get
  smaller, and moving it right or up or clockwise will make the number
  get bigger. However, if the joystick is using the ThrustMaster protocol
  (described in "Joystick Protocols" on page 124 of USBINTRO.DOC,
  see links below), the last (BY) axis is displaying the status of the
  (digital) 4-way Hat-switch. In this case, the number in BY will be
  maximum when the Hat-switch is centered, a little lower when up, a
  little lower yet when right, still lower when down, and minimum when
  left.
  The third and last section of THRUST will display the status of the
  joystick buttons, whether the joystick is using the 4-button or 15-
  button protocol (see "Joystick Protocols" on page 124 of USBINTRO.DOC,
  see links below) if you don't know what this means). If the joystick
  is using the 4-button protocol, the A1, A2, B1, and B2 columns will
  display the status of the four buttons (whether they are each pressed
  or not). If the joystick is using the 15-button protocol, the column
  labeled "15" will display the number of the button that is currently
  pressed (0 = no Button currently pressed, 1 = Button &num;1 pressed,
  etc.).
  THRUST can interact with the joysticks in two different ways, either
  through the BIOS (software) or directly through the hardware. The
  default method that THRUST uses depends on whether or not you have a
  digital joystick driver (like my SDWRGMPD or USBJSTIK programs)
  installed in memory or not. If you do have such a program, THRUST will
  use the BIOS (software) method by default. If you do not have such a
  program installed, THRUST will use the direct hardware method by
  default.
  No matter which access method THRUST would use by default, you can
  force it to use whichever method you want. To force THRUST to use the
  BIOS method, you would do the following:
    THRUST B
  To force THRUST to use the direct hardware method, you would do the
  following:
    THRUST D &num;
  where the &num; (the I/O port number) is optional. The I/O port number can
  be any number between 200h and 20Fh, which is the range of I/O port
  numbers reserved for game ports. The default I/O port number that game
  ports use is 201h, which is what THRUST will use if you don't specify a
  number (if you simply do "THRUST D"). Virtually all computers use port
  201h, so there is rarely a reason to specify any other port. In
  addition to the "D" (Direct), you can also use the alias "P" (Port) or
  "I" (I/O port) to tell THRUST to use the direct hardware method.
  After you are through viewing the raw joystick data, simply press a key
  on the keyboard and THRUST will stop.
