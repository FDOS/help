<h1>Command: sleep</h1>
<pre>
  SLEEP is a DOS port of the UNIX program by the same name.
  SLEEP is primarily intended to suspend execution of batch
  files for a specified time. SLEEP honours the DOS switchar
  setting and gives up time-slices to operating systems that
  support it.

<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
   leep [--help] [--version] seconds
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  --help
  /? *        displays help and exits successfully. When this option is
              used, sleep does not suspend execution. This option cannot
              be used with other options.  * Note: sleep checks for the
              switchar defined in DOS. If you have set a different
              <a href="../cnfigsys/switchar.htm">SWITCHAR</a> in DOS, sleep will honour your preferred setting.
  --version
  /v *        displays version and exits successfully. When this option
              is used, sleep does not suspend execution. This option
              cannot be used with other options.  * Note: sleep checks
              for the switchar defined in DOS. If you have set a
              different switchar in DOS, sleep will honour your preferred
              setting.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  The sleep command continues running until the specified number of
  seconds has elapsed.  sleep can delay execution of a program or
  produce periodic execution in conjunction with shell commands.
  The seconds argument can be either a number of seconds or a more
  general time description of the form nhnmns, with nh, nm, and s being
  optional. The maximum sleep duration is 2,147,483,647 seconds, which
  works out to 596,523 hours, 14 minutes and 7 seconds. That, I think,
  should be just about long enough for anybody. ;-)
  Possible exit status values (<a href="../batch/errorlvl.htm">ERRORLEVELS / EXITCODES</a>) are:
    0  Successful completion.
    2  Failure because seconds value was not specified or is invalid.

  Every now and then there is a "Runtime error 215 at 0000:096A".
  Especially with different virtual machines. The programmer is informed.

  sleep 24        sleeps for 24 seconds - works!
  sleep 5m        sleeps for 5 minutes - does not work
