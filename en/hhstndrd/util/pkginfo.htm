<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  PKGINFO is a command line utility to to display metadata and file
  information for installed packages. Mostly, using it is straight
  forward. Just a couple things to note. First, the list of packages
  can be limited by using an advanced wildcard. For example, *XMS* and
  ?D*N all return expected results. Second, is the search option. You
  can limit search to only specified packages or by default all packages
  will have there metadata searched. The search is basically another
  advanced wildcard as well. So, you could do a "pkginfo *fd* /s
  gnu*ver*2" and get a list of all packages that whose id contains FD and
  contain gnu*ver*2 somewhere in their metadata. You can also tack on /d
  to have the metadata displayed as well. For the most part, the order of
  command-line parameters makes no difference.
  PKGINFO supports NLS.
