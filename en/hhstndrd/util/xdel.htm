<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  XDEL was introduced by DR-DOS and a long time later M$ introduced
  <a href="../base/deltree.htm">DELTREE</a>. This implementation of XDEL is intended to be 100&percnt; compatible
  with DR-DOS version. If you find anything different, consider it a bug
  and send me a notofication, please.
  XDEL can be used in place of <a href="../base/deltree.htm">DELTREE</a>, but in fact it has more options,
  including:
    - Default is not to delete Read/Only files,
    - Option to include _or_not_ subdirectories,
    - Option to wipe all files before deleting,
    - Options to ask or not for confirmation, individualy or globally.
  XDEL has the following <a href="../batch/errorlvl.htm">ERRORLEVEL / EXITCODES</a>
    1 = Syntax error
    2 = Could not delete (for any reason, including operator cancel)
    3 = Out of memory

</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  Differences to deletree:
  XDEL  /RY  *.*
    will remove all files, including R/O and it will NOT ask for
    confirmation :)
  It has one major difference:
  XDEL /SRDN DIR\*.*
    will delete all files and subdirectories just as
    DELTREE /Y DIR\*.*
  but the directory DIR\  will NOT be removed (This is the DR-DOS
  standard)
