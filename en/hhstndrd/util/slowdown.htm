<h1>Command: slowdown</h1>
<pre>
  SLOWDOWN is a DOS program that temporarily Slows Down your computer, so
  that it runs like one of the older, slower computers. There are a some
  really good reasons for this:
  * There are many very good, useful (old) programs that were designed to
    run on the old, slow computers, and they do not run correctly on a
    new, fast computer.
  * You may want to temporarily slow down your computer when you are
    trying troubleshoot something that is going wrong with another
    program.
