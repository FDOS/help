<h1>Command: less</h1>
<pre>
     LESS is a program similar to <a href="../base/more.htm">MORE</a>, but which allows backward
     movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does
     not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with
     large input files it starts up faster than text editors like VI.
     Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a
     variety of terminals. There is even limited support for hardcopy
     terminals. (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be
     printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)

     Commands are based on both <a href="../base/more.htm">MORE</a> and VI. Commands may be preceded
     by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions below. The number
     is used by some commands, as indicated.
