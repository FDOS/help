<h1>Command: lpq1</h1>
<pre>
  lpq1 is a file compressor and archiver.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  lpq1 {a|x|l} archive [[-opt] files...]...
</pre>
<h2>Commands / Options:</h2>
<pre>
  Commands:
  a = create archive and compress named files.
  x = extract from archive.
  l = list contents.

  The "a" command creates a new archive and adds the named files.
  Wildcards are permitted if compiled with g++. Options and filenames may
  be in any order. Options apply only to filenames after the option, and
  override previous options.
  Options are:
    -s = store without compression.
    -c = compress (default).
  For example:
    <b>lpq1 a foo.lpq1 a.txt -s b.txt -c c.txt tmp/d.txt /tmp/e.txt</b>
  creates the archive foo.lpq(1) with 5 files (correct: foo.lpq! - 8.3!).
  The file b.txt is stored without compression. The other 4 files are
  compressed. If any named file does not exist, then it is omitted from
  the archive with a warning and the remaining files are added. An
  existing archive cannot be overwritten. There must be at least one
  filename on the command line.

  The "x" command extracts the archive contents, creating files exactly
  as named when the archive was created. Files cannot be overwritten.
  If a file already exists or cannot be created, then it is skipped.
  For example, "tmp/d.txt" would be skipped if either the current
  directory does not have a subdirectory tmp, or tmp is write protected,
  or tmp/d.txt already exists.
  If "x" is followed by one or more file names, then the output files
  are renamed in the order they were added to the archive and any
  remaining contents are extracted without renaming.
  For example:
    <b>lpq1 x foo.lpq1 x.txt y.txt</b>  (correct: foo.lpq! - 8.3!)
  would extract a.txt to x.txt and b.txt to y.txt, then extract c.txt,
  tmp/d.txt and /tmp/e.txt. If the command line has more filenames than
  the archive then the extra arguments are ignored. Options are not
  allowed.

  The "l" (letter l) command lists the contents. Any extra arguments
  are ignored.
  Any other command, or no command, displays a help message.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  Archives are "solid". You can only create new archives. You cannot
  modify existing archives. File names are stored and extracted exactly
  as named when the archive is created, but you have the option to rename
  them during extraction. Files are never clobbered.
</pre>
  <h2>ARCHIVE FORMAT:</h2>
  <pre>
    "lPq", 1, [filename {'\0' mode usize csize contents}...]...
  The first 4 bytes are "lPq\x01" (1 is the version number).
  A file is stored as one or more blocks. The filename is stored
  only in the first block as a NUL terminated string. Subsequent
  blocks start with a 0.
  The mode is 's' if the block is stored and 'c' if compressed.
    usize = uncompressed size as a 4 byte big-endian number (MSB first).
    csize = compressed size as a 4 byte big-endian number.
  The contents is copied from the file itself if mode is 's' or the
  compressed contents otherwise. Its length is exactly csize bytes.
  Files are compressed in lpaq1 7 format, which requires 387 MB memory.
  The model state is retained between files. lpaq1 is a context mixing
  compressor. See lpaq1.cpp from <b>http://cs.fit.edu/&tilde;mmahoney/compression/</b>
  for a detailed description of the algorithm.
