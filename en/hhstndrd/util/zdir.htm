<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  ZanySoft Dir (ZDir) is an easy to use and very powerful directory
  lister. The main purpose of ZDir is to replace the generic DIR command
  with a fast, easily readable display with more functionality. It can
  organize the file listing with many sorting options, color files based
  upon their extension, choose how many columns to use in the display,
  find files, draw a tree of the directory structure, use full-scale
  wildcards, and much more. Besides being powerful and easy to use, ZDir
  is also easy to configure with the included configuration program
  ZDircfg. It is very easy for a novice computer user to learn how to
  use ZDir, but has many features that expand upon the basic directory
  listing capability.
