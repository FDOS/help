<h1>Command: lfndos</h1>
<pre>
  LFNDOS provides the Windows95 Long Filename (LFN) API to DOS programs.
  Under Windows95, a DOS program can use long filenames by calling a set
  of interrupt functions, which Windows provides. For example, COMMAND.COM
  will allow long filenames when run as a DOS Prompt from Windows, but not
  if you restart in MS-DOS mode. Other programs such as EDIT.COM and all
  DJGPP programs use long filenames if available.

  LFNDOS provides the long filename service under DOS, allowing you to use
  long filenames with these programs. It uses the same format for storing
  the names on disk as Windows95 does, so you can view and use long file-
  names under both systems interchangeably.

  You don't even need Windows95 to use LFNDOS: you can use it, for example,
  to view the filenames on a disk from a friend who uses Windows95, instead
  of just getting the short ALONGF&tilde;1.DOC type names.

<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  LFNDOS [-u] [-t]
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  -u  Removes installed TSR from memory.
  -t  Installs as TSR, not memory resident (warning: bugs, may crash)
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  All that LFNDOS does is translate a long filename into its short
  equivalent and then pass the short name on to DOS. So, for example, on
  an 'open file' command, LFNDOS will search for a file with the given
  long name, find the short-name alias and then call the DOS open file
  function using the alias. For this reason LFNDOS is completely
  compatible with DOS, since it always passes on requests to DOS instead
  of handling them itsself. Using another example, remove directory,
  LFNDOS simply removes the long filename entries from the hard disk and
  then tells DOS to remove the directory with the short-name equivalent.
  So in this way, LFNDOS never has to cope with marking clusters in the
  FAT and such like, which keeps it reliable and simple (would you like
  it poking around your FAT all the time?).
