<h1>Command: bsum</h1>
<pre>
  BSUM - computes BSD checksums of files.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  BSUM filename
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  - none -
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  BSUM is a tiny tool (256 bytes!) that computes the BSD checksum of
  any file. It requires only a few kilobytes of memory, and is fast
  even on an 8086-class PC. BSUM supports files of any size (as long
  as your file system is able to handle them). The BSD checksum is
  displayed in hexadecimal format (ie. four alphanumeric characters,
  like "C2E1"). BSUM is an excellent candidate for verifying data
  integrity on systems that are very constrained in terms of disk
  space, memory or CPU power. Typically, bsum can be used to verify
  that files transferred by unreliable means arrived intact.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  echo "Hi, how are you?"&gt; hi.txt
  echo "Hi, how are you?"&gt; howare.txt
  echo Hi, how are you?&gt; hi1.txt
  echo Hi, how are you?&gt; howare1.txt
  bsum hi.txt             gives result: E9E6
  bsum howare.txt         gives result: E9E6
  bsum hi1.txt            gives result: 93A8
  bsum howare1.txt        gives result: 93A8
  hi.txt and howare.txt are identical, so the BSD checksums are
  identical. Same with hi1.txt and howare1.txt.
