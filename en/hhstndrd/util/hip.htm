  Hide In Picture (HIP) is a steganography program. It is a program that
  allows you to "hide" any kind of file inside standard bitmap pictures.
  The pictures look like normal images, so people will not suspect they
  contain hidden data.
  You can use a password to hide your files, and only those who know the
  password use are able to retrieve them - without it, people cannot
  even be sure there is something hidden in the image.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  To hide a file inside a picture, use:
    hip h source_image input_file [destination_image] [options]
  If the destination image name is not specified, the destination image
  is written on top of the source image.

  To retrieve a file from a picture, use:
    hip r source_image [output_file] [options]
  If the output file name is not specified, the name saved in the picture
  is used.

  To erase a file previously hidden in a picture, use:
    hip e source_image [destination_image] [options]
  If the destination image name is not specified, the destination image
  is written on top of the source image.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  fxxxxxx - file name to write in image
    By default, the name of the input file is written in the image. Use
    this option to specify a different name to write. If you use it
    without specifying a file name, no name is written.
  pxxxxxx - password to use
    When used with the hide or retrieve operations, this option specifies
    the password to use for hiding/retrieving the file. If you do not use
    this option, you will be asked to enter a password (recommended).
    When used with the erase operation, HIP assumes there is a file
    hidden with the specified password and overwrites only the first bits
    of the hidden data; if the image contains a file hidden with a
    different password, it will not be erased correctly.
  thh or thhhhhh - transparent color index or RGB value
    Use this option to set the transparent color for the image. To
    specify the palette index for the transparent color of an 8-bit
    image, use two hexadecimal digits (00-FF). To specify the RGB value
    for the transparent color, use six hexadecimal digits (the first two
    represent the red component, the next two represent the green one
    and the last two, the blue one). If you specify the RGB value for
    the transparent color of an 8-bit image and there is more than one
    palette entry with that color, the one with the lowest index will be
    used.
  ex - encryption algorithm
    Use this option to choose the encryption algorithm: a for Blowfish
    (default) or b for Rijndael.
  ix - image format
    Use this option to choose the image format for the output file. If
    the format is not specified, HIP will choose the format based on the
    file extension; if the extension is not recognized, the file will be
    saved as a Windows Bitmap (BMP) picture.
  c - write the CRC-32 of the data
    Use this option to append a checksum to the data to identify data
    corruption. This is enabled by default.
  C - do not write the CRC-32 of the data
    Use this option if you do not wish to append a checksum to the data;
    see above.
  h - hide the password characters
    If the p option is not used, the program asks the user for the
    password. Use this option to show *'s (asterisks) instead of the
    password characters. This is enabled by default.
  H - do not hide the password characters
    Use this option to show the password characters while you are typing
    them.
  v - view file information only
    Use this option if you only want to see whether the file fits inside
    the picture when hiding, or the name and size of the hidden file when
    retrieving. The destination image or output file is not written.
  q -quiet mode
    Use this option if you do not want to see unnecessary messages (such
    as the file information and status bars). The only things that will
    be shown are password prompts, confirmation messages and error
    messages.
  y -answer 'yes' to all confirmation questions
    By default, the program asks for confirmation before overwriting a
    file that already exists. If this option is specified, you will not
    be asked for confirmation.
