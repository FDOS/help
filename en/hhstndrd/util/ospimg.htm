<h1>Command: dskimage (ospimg)</h1>
<pre>
  DSKIMAGE, the OSPlus Disk Imager is a utility that lets you read floppy
  disks and create images of them on your hard disk. These can then be
  written to a CD, zipped and e-mailed or uploaded to the Internet.
  DSKIMAGE also lets you write these images back to a floppy disk. Be
  warned that any existing data on the floppy will be DESTROYED when
  writing an image.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  - none - dskimage uses a user interface.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  - none -
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  The image you write doesn't have to have been created with the Disk
  Imager. There are no identifing "marks" in the image file that say it's
  been created with the Disk Imager - it's just the exact contents of the
  floppy disk. This can be written back to disk with other tools such as
  RAWRITE (which Disk Imager is based on). Please note that some imaging
  tools such as "DIM" have their own headers - these disks may not work
  properly when written.
  DSKIMAGE seems to have problems with ctmouse. If you have problems,
  use "ALT + highlighted character" instead.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  To create an image file from a disk, do the following:
    1. Start Disk Imager, either by typing DSKIMAGE or double-clicking
       the icon if using Windows or another GUI.
    2. Choose Read Image from Disk from the File menu, or press F2. A
       dialog will appear.
    3. Type the name of the file you want created (plus the path), or
       click the Browse dialog and do it that way.
    4. Click OK to read the disk and create a disk image.

  To write an image file back to a disk, do the following:
    1. Start the Disk Imager, as above.
    2. Choose Write Image to Disk from the File menu, or press F3. A
       dialog will appear.
    3. Type the full path to the file you want to write to the disk,
       or click the Browse dialog to find it graphically.
    4. Click OK to write the disk image to the disk.
