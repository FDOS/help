<h1>Command: cabextract</h1>
<pre>
  CABEXTRACT - program to extract files from Microsoft cabinet (.cab)
  archives
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  cabextract [-ddir] [-f] [-Fpattern] [-eencoding] [-h] [-l]
  [-L] [-p] [-q] [-s] [-t] [-v]  cabinet files ...
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  -d dir Extracts all files into the directory dir.
  -f     Corrupted cabinet files will be 'fixed' to salvage whatever is
         possible from them. File entries with bad folders or names will
         be skipped rather than rejecting the entire cabinet file.
         Impossible file lengths will be truncated to extract as much as
         possible, including when you're missing later files in a cabinet
         set. Corrupted MSZIP blocks and failed block checksums will be
         ignored. Warnings will be printed if any of these conditions are
         met.
  -F pattern
         Only files with names that match the shell pattern pattern shall
         be listed, tested or extracted. On non-GNU systems, this match
         may be case-sensitive.
  -e encoding
         Specify the character encoding of filenames inside the cabinet
         files. This is only needed if you find cabinet files with garbled
         filenames; most software creates CAB files with either ASCII or
         UTF8 filenames. The list of supported encodings is given by
         the command "iconv -l".
  -h     Prints a page of help and exits.
  -l     Lists the contents of the given cabinet files, rather than
         extracting them.
  -L     When extracting cabinet files, makes each extracted file's name
         lowercase.
  -p     Files shall be extracted to standard output.
  -q     When extracting cabinet files, suppresses all messages except
         errors and warnings.
  -s     When testing, listing or extracting cabinets which span multiple
         files, only cabinet files given on the command line shall be used.
  -t     Tests the integrity of the cabinet. Files are decompressed, but
         not written to disk or standard output. If the file successfully
         decompresses, the MD5 checksum of the file is printed.
  -v     If given alone on the command line, prints the version of cab-
         extract and exits. Given with a list of cabinet files, it will
         list the contents of the cabinet files.

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  CABEXTRACT is a program that un-archives files in the Microsoft cabinet
  file format (.cab) or any binary file which contains an embedded cabinet
  file (frequently found in .exe files). CABEXTRACT will extract all files
  from all cabinet files specified on the command line.
  To extract a multi-part cabinet consisting of several files, only the
  first cabinet file needs to be given as an argument to CABEXTRACT as it
  will automatically look for the remaining files. To prevent CABEXTRACT
  from extracting cabinet files you did not specify, use the -s option.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  Extracting files from a cabinet file:
    $ cabextract wibble.cab
  Extracting files from an executable which contains a cabinet file:
    $ cabextract wibble.exe
    [cabextract will automatically search executables for embedded
    cabinets]
  Extracting files from a set of cabinet files; wib01.cab, wib02.cab, ...:
    $ cabextract wib01.cab
    [cabextract will automatically get the names of the other files]
  Extracting files to a directory of your choice (in this case, 'boogie'):
    $ cabextract -d boogie wibble.cab
    [cabextract will create the directory if it does not already exist]
  Listing files from a cabinet file:
    $ cabextract -l wibble.cab
  Testing the integrity of a cabinet file, without extracting it:
    $ cabextract -t wibble.cab
