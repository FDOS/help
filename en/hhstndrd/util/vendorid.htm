<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  ?  Show this HELP screen
  O  Show all aliases for these command line OPTIONS
  E  Show all ErrorLevels (DOS Return Codes)
  The Following Options require a Vendor Type (PCI, PNP, or USB) to be
  entered first, and also require an appropriate Data File (VENDORID.PCI,
  .PNP, .USB) to be located in the same directory as this executable file
  (VENDORID.COM).
  PNP aaa          Show Vendor Name for PNP Vendor ID aaa
                   aaa is a three-letter acronym (e.g., SNY = Sony Corp).
  {PCI/USB} &num;      Show Vendor Name for {PCI/USB} Vendor ID &num;
                   &num; is Decimal (0-65535) or Hex (0h-FFFFh, 0x0-0xFFFF).

  {PCI/PNP/USB} "String"  Search for "String" in {PCI/PNP/USB} Vendor
                          Names. Search is case-insensitive.

  {PCI/PNP/USB}    A List ALL {PCI/PNP/USB} Vendor IDs and Names.
                   You may want to use one or more of the DOS Filters
                   (FIND, SORT, MORE) with the ALL Option.
                   "VENDORID USB All | FIND "h  " | SORT /+8 | MORE",
                   for example, will sort the entire USB Vendor Name
                   Table by Vendor Name, and pause after each screen.
  {PCI/PNP/USB} S  List the {PCI/PNP/USB} data SOURCE details

  If running from inside another program (not running from the command-
  line), the Option can be followed with a hex address (Segment:Offset)
  to which the output will be written.

  VENDORID is a program that searches for and displays the names of all of
  the known PCI, PNP, or USB Vendor ID's. PNP (Plug-N-Play) ID's are
  three letter acronyms (for example, ICO = Intel Corporation) assigned by
  Microsoft, and will receive limited discussion here since they do not
  directly apply to USB devices. In the PCI (Peripheral Component
  Interface) and USB (Universal Serial Bus) architectures, each vendor
  (manufacturer) registers with the appropriate organization, and receives
  a Vendor ID (a number). Every device that the Vendor manufacturers is
  required to have the ID stored in the firmware of the device, so that
  the device can be identified automatically (using software). In
  addition to the Vendor ID, PCI and USB Devices also contain a field for
  the Device ID. While the Vendor ID is assigned by the USB or PCI
  organization (and requires a registration fee), the Device ID's are
  assigned and maintained by the individual Vendor.
  Even though the PCI and USB organizations are the only ones who can
  officially assign Vendor ID's, some Vendors make up their own, "borrow"
  ID's from each other, change their names, get taken over by other
  companies, go out of business, etc. Therefore, it is very difficult to
  maintain an accurate list of names, since it is a "moving target". On
  top of that, the PCI and USB organizations are not always willing to
  release their official information freely (even for something as simple
  as the list of Vendor ID's). Over the years, there have been several
  volunteers that have gathered information about the Vendors and Devices
  for both USB and PCI. However, you cannot always believe all of the
  information that you find, even if it comes directly from the
  organization itself.
  I have taken the information from several different locations (including
  the USB and PCI organizations where possible), and combined them into
  two sets data, one set for PCI and one for USB. The VENDORID executable
  file itself (VENDORID.COM) does not actually contain the data, but
  simply allows you to look and search through the data that is in the
  data files (VENDORID.USB, VENDORID.PCI, and VENDORID.PNP). The data
  files must be in the same directory as the executable file
  (VENDORID.COM). The data files are in a simple ASCII text format, so
  you can easily look at and modify the data yourself with a simple text
  editor if you are so inclined.
  There are four basic functions that VENDORID provides for the data. The
  first function will tell you where the data came from (which web sites
  the data came from, and the date that the data was downloaded). For
  example, to see where I got the PCI data from, you would do the
  following:
    VENDORID PCI Source
  Similarly, to see where I got the PNP data from, you would do the
  following:
    VENDORID PNP Source
  The second function that VENDORID provides allows you to discover the
  name of the company associated with a specific Vendor ID (number or
  acronym). To do this, you must provide VENDORID with the Vendor ID
  number (either in decimal or hexadecimal format), or three-letter
  acronym (case-insensitive). To indicate a hexadecimal number, you can
  either precede the number with a "0x" (C-style), follow the number with
  an "h", or both. For example, the following lines will all provide the
  same result:
    VENDORID PCI 0x8086
    VENDORID PCI   8086h
    VENDORID PCI 0x8086h
    VENDORID PCI 32902
  The third function that VENDORID provides allows you to search for
  Vendor ID's by knowing all or part of the vendor's company name. To do
  this, you provide a string to search for, surrounded by quotes (double
  quotes, left single quotes, or right single quotes). The search is
  case-insensitive. For example, the following lines will provide the
  same result:
    VENDORID USB "Intel"
    VENDORID USB 'intel'
    VENDORID USB 'INTEL'
  The results in this case would of course include "Intel Corp", along
  with several other vendors that included "intel" somewhere in their name
  (e.g., "Intelligent", "Intellix", etc.).
  If you want to see the entire list of USB vendors, you would do the
  following:
    VENDORID USB AllVendors
  The VENDORID.USB, VENDORID.PCI, and VENDORID.PNP data files store the
  information sorted by Vendor ID (number or acronym) rather than by
  vendor name. VENDORID does not offer any kind of sorting other than by
  Vendor ID. If you want the display sorted in some fashion other than by
  Vendor ID (say, by vendor name), or want to filter it some other way
  (say, do a case-sensitive vendor name search), you will need to use an
  external filter. The standard filters that come with DOS are FIND,
  SORT, and MORE, and if you're very familiar with DOS you should already
  understand them. There are also several "after market" filters that you
  can obtain. For example, if you want to sort the entire PCI vendor list
  by vendor name, and pause the screen after each page has been displayed,
  you would do the following:
    VENDORID PCI All | FIND "h " | SORT /+8 | MORE
  The company names as stored and displayed in VENDORID are limited to 40
  characters, so are almost always abbreviated in some fashion (Company is
  always "Co", Incorporated is always "Inc", etc.). If you edit the data
  files yourself, and make a vendor name longer than 40 characters, the
  name will be truncated to 40 characters when it is displayed by
  VENDORID.COM.
  The format of the data files is fairly self explanatory if you look at
  them. They can have blank lines and comment lines -- comment lines
  always start with a semicolon (";"). The lines containing the data
  sources start with "Source =". A line containing a Vendor ID and name
  will start with the Vendor ID (number or acronym), followed by at least
  one space, followed by the vendor name. VENDORID does not do any
  testing to verify sort order, duplicates, etc., in the data file, but
  rather simply assumes the data file is correct.

  VENDORID has an extensive documentation that is beyond the scope of
  this help. For more information see:
