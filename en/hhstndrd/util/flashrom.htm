<h1>Command: flashrom</h1>
<pre>
  FlASHROM is a program for saving and updating your BIOS firmware,
  provided you have an EEPROM chip on which it is stored.
  Saving your system BIOS to a file usually goes fine,
  erasing and writing can be dangerous steps, don't perform them
  if you cannot afford a non-working machine.

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  This version of FLASHROM is OUTDATED (2011-28-12,v0.9.4-r1452).
  It is not recommended to use it. Most of the flashable hardware
  has its own flash tool and a firmware that can be found via a
  search engine and the model name and the manufacturer.
