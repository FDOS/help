<h1>Command: slicer</h1>
<pre>
  SLICER is a simple file archiving and slicing/spanning program for DOS.
  SLICER is very similar to tar. However, it has different primary focus
  and objectives.

 &num;&num;&num; How is *File SLICER* different?
  Unlike other archiving utilities, *File SLICER* is more of a multi-
  language group based file resource splitter, archiver and installer
  hybrid utility.
 *Hunh?*
  When files are added to an archive, they may be given group tags.
  These tags can be used to pull only specific classes of files from the
  archive. For example, if storing a program, you could tag source files
  as ***src*** and store binaries ungrouped. Then on extraction, the
  binaries would always get extracted. But, the sources files would only
  get extracted if the ***src*** group is is requested.
  Then the multi-language thing... Language specific text can be embedded
  into an archive. This text may be displayed automatically during the
  extraction of an archive and also supports group tags. So, you could
  embed English and Spanish text at the start of a ***src*** group that
  gets displayed when the ***src*** group begins extraction.
 *Installer kinda stuff. Well, only to the extent that multi-language
  text can be flagged whith the **/M** switch to require user acceptance.
  This would allow a license to be displayed and accepted before a group
  is extracted.
 *A file splitter thingy. It always works in splitting mode. The size for
  each file is defined when an archive is created and cannot be changed
  unless it is re-sliced. The primary archive file always ends in **SAF**
  and additional files are numbered **001** and up. The first portion of
  primary archive file's header is in pure text and can be viewed by
  simply using the type command. If any additional non-language specific
  text was appended to the header using the **/m** switch, it will be
  shown as well.
 &num;&num;&num; One more thing...
  The FreeDOS installer for the Floppy Edition uses **SLICEREX** to
  perform the installation of all the software packages. This is specially
  tuned version of **SLICER** for the primary function of extracting
  FreeDOS under the extreme memory limitations (everything loaded into
  low memory) that the Floppy Edition operates. **SLICER/EX** is still
  very new. So if for whatever reason the installation of packages fails,
  you can try again and turn on logging for **SLICEREX** by setting an
  environment variable **SLICER.LOG**. This log is gigantic and pushes
  6mb under normal installations. It also really slows down the instal-
  lation process. When you set the variable to turn on logging, I
  recommend using **set SLICER.LOG=C:\SLICER.LOG** for the file.
