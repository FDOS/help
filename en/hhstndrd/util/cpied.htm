<h1>Command: cpied</h1>
<pre>
  CPIED is a CPI file editor. It can edit CPI files which are used by
  DOS to store codepage information.
  The program should be able to run on any IBM-PC compatible computer*
  with an IBM-VGA compatible video card and DOS** or Windows*** operating
  system or a DOS emulator****. To save CPX files UPX (upx.sourceforge.
  net) must be installed.
  **The program should run on any DOS that is not older than 3.3. It was
  tested on following systems:
    MS-DOS  3.3  - no problems
    PC-DOS  3.3  - no problems
    MS-DOS  4.0  - no problems
    MS-DOS  4.01 - no problems
    MS-DOS  5.0  - no problems
    MS-DOS  6.0  - no problems
    MS-DOS  6.2  - no problems
    MS-DOS  6.21 - no problems
    MS-DOS  6.22 - no problems
    MS-DOS  7.1  - no problems
    FreeDOS 1.0  - no problems
    FreeDOS 1.1  - no problems
    PTS-DOS 6.8  - no problems, but in "safe mode" there is a small
                   display bug and cpx2cpi crashes the system.
  ***The program should run without problems on any DOS-based version of
  Windows. It was tested on following systems:
    Windows 3.11 for workgroups - no problems
    Windows 98 SE               - no problems
  There can be problems in NT-based versions of windows:
    On windows XP there can be display errors with some video cards. It
    was tested on computers with Windows XP SP3 and on some of them there
    were display errors. Propably, the video card drivers are responsible
    for this.
  On Windows Vista and 7, the system may refuse to launch this program
  (or any other fullscreen DOS program) or not. It depends on the video
  card driver.
  On 64 bit systems the program will not run.
  ****The program was tested on DOSBox 0.63 and 0.73 and there were no
  problems. The previous version of the program (1.0) does not run on
  DOSBox 0.63. No other emulators were tested.
  The program is not tested on all of the systems after every update!

  The following file formats are supported:
    1. FONT - used by MS-DOS, PC-DOS, Windows 1.x, 2.x, 3.x.
    2. FONT.NT - used by Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7.
       This format is not fully supported. Files can be loaded in
       this format, but can only be saved in FONT format.
       Windows supports both formats, so this is not a problem.
    3. CPX - used by FreeDOS. To save CPX files UPX (upx.sourceforge.net)
       must be installed
  The following file formats are not supported:
    4. DRFONT - used by DR-DOS

  Loaded files must meet the following restrictions:
    1. Number of all codepages cannot be 0 or bigger than 16.
    2. Codepages must have different numbers.
    3. Codepages cannot contain 0 or more than 3 fonts.
    4. Width of characters in a font must be equal to 8.
    5. Height of characters in font must be equal to 8, 14 or 16
    6. Fonts in a codepage must have different heights
    7. Fonts must contain exactly 256 characters
    8. All fonts must be screen fonts, not printer fonts.

  The following actions can be performed:
    1. creating a new CPI
    2. loading a CPI file
    3. saving a CPI file
    4. loading a codepage into VGAmemory using the <a href="../base/mode.htm">MODE</a> command*
    5. editing the appearance of characters
    6. creating a new codepage
    7. changing a number of an existing codepage
    8. deleting an existing codepage
    9. creating a new font
   10. deleting an existing font

   *4 A CPI file is saved and used as a parameter to the DOS <a href="../base/mode.htm">MODE</a>
      command which loads a codepage into the video card memory:
       mode con:cp prep=((number) path)
       mode con:cp sel=number
      This will not work if <a href="../base/mode.htm">MODE.COM</a> or <a href="../base/display.htm">DISPLAY.SYS</a> are not installed on
      the system. It will also not work on Windows XP or newer or DOS
      3.3. DOS will not be able to load the codepage if the CPI file is
      bigger than 64KB. Do not use this option if the codepage is not
      finished because you will not be able to read anything you type
      anymore.

  Controls:
  Everything can be controlled by the keyboard or mouse (if there is a
  mouse installed).
