  <h1>XKeyb</h1>



 Extended keyboard driver for FreeDOS.
 XKeyb contains the keyboard driver and several other keyboard utilities.

   XKEYB    Keyboard driver, configure a keyboard for a layout other than
            standard US layout (codepage 437).
            Program keys to produce strings to the keyboard buffer.
            Enables the XKEYB-API, with which you can associate  routines
            to key events.
   XKEYBRES Reduced version of XKEYB (with a smaller executable size)  to 
            increase the probabilities to be  loaded  into  upper  memory
            (with loadhigh).
   SCANKBD  Scans a keyboard layout into a configuration file.
   KEYMAN   Keyboard macro recorder.
   LISTXDEF Lists the keyboard layout plus the macro definitions.


 Syntax:

   <b>XKEYB</b> [<b>/X</b>nn] [<b>/Q</b>] [<b>/U</b>] &lt;Layout_file&gt;
   <b>XKEYBRES</b> [<b>/X</b>nn] [<b>/Q</b>] [<b>/U</b>]

   OPTIONS

   /Xnn                 Allocate nn bytes of memory for Extension Strings
                        (macros).
   /Q                   Suppress the output of LIST paragraphs from
                        the configuration file.
   /U                   Remove the resident copy of XKEYB from memory
                        (if installed).
   &lt;Layout_File&gt;        Layout and codepage  specific  file, such  as
                        GR.KEY or SP.KEY .
                        A path may be included, and the extension may  be
                        omitted.
                        KEY files  are  searched  in  current  directory,
                        XKEYB program directory  and  %PATH%  environment
                        string.

 <i>Note: XKEYBRES does not admit the parameter</i> &lt;layout_file&gt; <i>but XKEYB will
 load the information into XKEYB or XKEYBRES if either of them is already
 present in memory.</i>

 You can program FreeDOS so that keyboard is configured at boot  time  by
 means of AUTOEXEC.BAT. Append the command line into your AUTOEXEC.BAT to
 do this.

 <b>Example:</b>
 To use a German keyboard when your KEYBOARD.SYS file is in the DOS
 directory on drive C, type the following command:

 xkeyb gr

 or alternatively you can use the formula

 LOADHIGH  XKEYBRES /Q
 XKEYB GR

 that will load XKEYBRES into upper memory (if upper memory is available).

 <b>Notes:</b>
 There are countries listed above for which there are not  layouts
 such as Argentina, Australia and Austria but they are listed here
 because they are mentioned on MS-DOS&copy; documentation.

 There is a reference to Ireland on MS-DOS&copy; v6.2x  documentation
 which actually points to the UK layout. There is an irish  layout
 available at the Full Layout Pack.

 There are references to Canada (English) and Canada (French)  but
 actually both of them point to the same layout.

 The bosnian, croatian and slovenian layouts are all the same.
 They match the "YU" layout found at MS-DOS&copy; v6.x which presents
 a dead key with cedilla and diaresis below the &lt;ESC&gt; key.

 The modern "YU" layout refers to the Serbian Latin keyboard which
 presents a deadkey with cedilla and tilde below the &lt;ESC&gt; key and
 is available on the Full Layout Pack only.

 "-cp437" layouts are provided for CGA monitors and only when that
 codepage is listed as primary or secondary for a layout according
 to the major industry specifications. For instance, the brazilian
 layout can work with "850, 437" on MS-DOS&copy;.
 Due to cp437 limitations, there are labeled characters on several
 keyboards that won't be echoed.
  
 <a name="scankbd">
 <a name="listxdef">
 <b>SCANKBD and LISTXDEF</b>:

 Syntax:

   <b>SCANKBD</b> <Configuration File>
   <b>LISTXDEF</b>

   SCANKBD scans current keyboard layout (XKEYB or other keyboard driver)
   to the configuration file, generating a .KEY compatible file.
   LISTXDEF lists the XKEYB layout and all the macro definitions to console.

  Most probably you would like to do

  LISTXDEF > MYFILE.KEY

  to save all your macro definitions.

 <a name="keyman">
 <b>KEYMAN</b>:

   KEYMAN is an interactive macro recorder for use with XKEYB.


   XKEYB must be resident in memory before KEYMAN can be installed.

   Once installed, press F11 to pop up the KEYMAN window. Enter  a  macro
   by pressing the key to  assign  the  macro  to  (eg. CTRL-D), then the
   keystrokes to be assigned to the macro, then F11 again to save it.

   You can delete macro keystrokes using the BACKSPACE  key. To  enter  a
   BACKSPACE keystroke in the macro, use &lt;ALT&gt;-&lt;Keypad 8&gt;.

   To change the Hotkey (F11 by default), pop up the KEYMAN window, press
   the hotkey again, then press the new hotkey.

   LISTXDEF.EXE can be used to save recorded macros  as  a  configuration
   file.
