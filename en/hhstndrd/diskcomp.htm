<h1>diskcomp</h1>
Compares the contents of two floppy disks, track by track 
<pre>
   <b>diskcomp [d: [d:]] [options]</b>
</pre>
<h2>Options</h2>
<pre>
  <b>d:</b>
  The drive letter for a floppy disk.  If only one drive letter is
  given, assume the working drive (if a floppy drive.)  If no drive
  letters are given, assume both are the working drive (if a floppy).
  If both drives are the same, diskcomp will read one floppy at a
  time, and you will need to swap floppies.

  <b>/1</b>
  Compare only the first sides of the disks, even if double-sided
  disks.

  <b>/8</b>
  Compare only the first 8 sectors per track.

  <b>/40</b>
  Compare only the first 40 tracks

  <b>/b</b>
  Forces diskcomp to user the BIOS to access the floppy disk drive.
  (The BIOS is slower, but might be required for compatibility on some
   machines.)
