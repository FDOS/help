      DEVICE=drive:path\fdxms.sys [options]
      DEVICE=drive:path\fdxms286.sys [options]
</pre>
Fdxms is for 386+ computers.

<h2>Options</h2>
<pre>

 NUMHANDLES=<number>
 Sets the number of XMS handles. Default is 32. Minimum
 is two (not much use of XMS without any handles!) and
 maximum is currently 1024. Each handle takes 5 bytes
 (FDXMS.SYS) or 9 bytes (FDXXMS.SYS).

  BIOS
  Makes FDXMS to always call the BIOS through INT15
  instead of using its own protected mode switching.

  PS
  Changes to the particular A20 handling necessary on
  PS/2 machines.

  GEODE
  Removes delays while changing the A20 line. Reported
  to help FDXMS to work on National Semiconductor's
  Geode GX1 processor.

  DELAY=<number>
  Number of calls to the delay routine after changing
  the A20 line. If you receive the error message "Unable
  to switch A20 address line", try setting it to a big
  value (say 4000) and see if it helps. Then fine tune
  it as you want as low a value as possible for
  speed. Default is 1. Maximum is 65535 and 0 maps to
  65536.</pre>
